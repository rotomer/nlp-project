ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. The following MDA describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations, and critical accounting estimates. OVERVIEW Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our business is divided into three business segments, which operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, electronics, high tech, telecommunications, industrial, consumer goods, paper and paper products, office equipment, food and beverage, general retail industries and governments. The Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing, contract maintenance, contract related maintenance, and commercial rental of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. FMS revenue and assets in 2007 were $3.75 billion and $6.17 billion, respectively, representing 57% of our consolidated revenue and 90% of consolidated assets. The Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting including distribution and transportation services throughout North America and in Latin America, Europe and Asia. SCS revenue in 2007 was $2.25 billion, representing 34% of our consolidated revenue. The Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S. DCC revenue in 2007 was $568 million, representing 9% of our consolidated revenue. 2007 was a year of significant accomplishments for us, as we realized record earnings for the fourth consecutive year, despite weakening economic conditions in the U.S. Continued development of our global sales and operating capabilities in each of our business segments, continued focus on financial discipline and cost and safety management while investing for strategic growth provided support for earnings expansion. Total revenue was $6.57 billion, up 4% from $6.31 billion in 2006, while our operating revenue (total revenue less fuel and subcontracted transportation) measure was up $182 million or 4%. Operating revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments. The growth in SCS revenue was driven primarily by new and expanded business and higher volumes particularly in international markets served. The growth in FMS revenue was driven by higher full service lease revenue resulting from higher lease rates and business expansion. Comparisons for 2007 were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates of 1.2% related to our international operations. Earnings from continuing operations grew to $254 million from $249 million in 2006 and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations increased to $4.24 from $4.04 in 2006. Included in earnings from continuing operations are certain items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations. The following discussion provides a summary of the 2007 and 2006 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MDA and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: 2007 Earnings in 2007 included an after tax gain of $6 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, related to the sale of property in the third quarter. Earnings in 2007 included restructuring charges of $8 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted common share, related to third quarter cost management and process improvement actions. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Earnings in 2007 included a fourth quarter income tax benefit of $3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, associated primarily with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. 2006 Earnings in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings in 2006 included a one time, non cash pension accounting charge of $4 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted common share, to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations were $252 million, up 2% from $246 million in 2006. Comparable earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share were $4.21, up 6% from $3.99 in 2006. All business segments contributed to the improved results. The earnings growth was driven primarily by lower pension and safety and insurance costs and contractual revenue growth within our FMS business segment, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market in FMS for 2007. With the continuing improvements in earnings and cash flows over the past four years, we repurchased a total of 3.9 million shares of common stock in 2007 for $209 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 17% to $0.84 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2007, we acquired Pollock NationaLease and paid $75 million. Capital expenditures decreased to $1.19 billion compared with $1.76 billion in 2006. The reduction in capital expenditures reflects lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacements and expansion of customer fleets. Our debt decreased from $2.82 billion at December 31, 2006 to $2.78 billion at December 31, 2007 due to improved operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment offset by spending required to support the contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our debt to equity ratio also decreased to 147% from 164% in 2006. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio decreased to 157% from 168% in 2006. 2008 Outlook Our outlook for 2008 is positive, despite uncertainty of U.S. economic conditions. Our efforts will focus on the implementation of our contractual revenue growth strategies, including the evaluation of selective acquisitions, across all business segments while retaining financial discipline. Total revenue is targeted to decline by 6% while operating revenue is expected to increase by 5%. The 2008 forecast for total revenue includes the impact of net revenue reporting in 2008 for subcontracted transportation revenues previously reported on a gross basis. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition for additional information. We will also continue to focus on cost and safety management and process improvement actions that complement our growth strategies and establish a foundation for sustainable long term profitable growth. As a result, we expect earnings per diluted common share in 2008 to grow by 7% to 10% compared to 2007 comparable earnings per diluted common share. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 405,464 392,973 357,088 3 % 10 Provision for income taxes 151,603 144,014 129,460 5 11 Earnings from continuing operations $ 253,861 248,959 227,628 2 % 9 Per diluted common share $ 4.24 4.04 3.53 5 % 14 Net earnings(1) $ 253,861 248,959 226,929 2 % 10 Per diluted common share $ 4.24 4.04 3.52 5 % 15 Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 59,845 61,578 64,560 (3 )% (5 ) (1) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased to $405 million in 2007 compared with $393 million in 2006, reflecting the benefits of (i) lower pension costs; (ii) contractual revenue growth in the FMS business segment (iii) lower safety and insurance costs; (iv) lower incentive based compensation; and (v) lower depreciation as a result of our annual depreciation review implemented January 1, 2007. Our 2007 NBT also benefited from a gain on sale of property of $10 million. These items more than offset the significant impact of weak U.S. commercial rental market demand and lower used vehicle sales results in our FMS business segment. Our 2006 NBT was impacted by a one time charge of $6 million to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $254 million in 2007 compared with $249 million in 2006. Earnings from continuing operations in 2007 included an income tax benefit of $3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due primarily to enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2007 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT increased to $393 million in 2006 compared with $357 million in 2005, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. The 2006 operating performance improvement was driven by contractual revenue growth in each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market on our FMS business segment results in the second half of 2006. Our 2006 NBT was impacted by a one time charge of $6 million to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million in 2006 compared with $228 million in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included a state income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes in the State of Ohio. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2006 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. See subsequent discussion within Consolidated Results and Operating Results by Business Segment for additional information on the results noted above. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 4,162,644 4,096,046 3,921,191 2 % 4 Supply Chain Solutions 2,250,282 2,028,489 1,637,826 11 24 Dedicated Contract Carriage 567,640 568,842 543,268 5 Eliminations (414,571 ) (386,734 ) (361,438 ) (7 ) (7 ) Total $ 6,565,995 6,306,643 5,740,847 4 % 10 Operating revenue(1) $ 4,636,557 4,454,231 4,210,881 4 % 6 (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from increased lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2007 and 2006, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,776,999 2,735,752 2,587,733 2 % 6 Percentage of revenue 42% 43% 45% Operating expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense grew in 2006 principally as a result of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increase in operating expenses. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,410,388 1,397,391 1,262,160 1 % 11 Percentage of revenue 21% 22% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 31% 30% Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. The number of employees at December 31, 2007 increased to approximately 28,800 compared with 28,600 at December 31, 2006. Pension expense totaled $29 million in 2007 compared with $70 million in 2006. The decrease in 2007 pension expense is due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Pension expense in 2006 was also impacted by a pension accounting charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), which represented a one time, non cash charge to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations due to the removal of a substantive commitment. All other decreases to pension expense primarily impact our FMS business segment, which employs the majority of our employees who participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. See Note 23, Employee Benefit 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $21 million in 2008 because of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. However, we expect this decrease to be principally offset by our new enhanced 401(k) plan. Our 2008 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Our incentive based compensation program is comprised of annual cash incentive awards, amounts earned under discontinued cash based long term incentive plans and 401(k) company contributions which are based on the achievement of certain levels of financial performance generally over one fiscal year. The performance metrics and targets are based on internal business plans and center around operating revenue, earnings, earnings per share and return on capital. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in the current year. Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount, increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense also increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared to 2005. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $950,500 865,475 638,319 10 % 36 Percentage of revenue 14% 14% 11% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2007 and 2006, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we have determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, contract revenue associated with this portion of the subcontracted transportation contract totaled $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 815,962 743,288 740,415 10 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (44,094 ) (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (13 ) 8 Equipment rental 93,337 90,137 87,324 4 3 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from purchases during the past two years. In addition, adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale exceeded prior year levels by $18 million due to wholesale activity taken this year in light of increased average inventory levels. This 2007 activity does not reflect our long term expectations of residual values for revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 to $743 million compared to $740 million in 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases during 2006. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count. Both 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation is not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 and 2005 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007 and 2006. These residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared to 2006 and increased pre tax earnings for 2006 by approximately $13 million compared to 2005. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. The decrease was offset partially by a 21% increase in the number of vehicles sold in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on our used truck inventory at December 31, 2007, we expect the level of wholesale activity to decrease in 2008. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $160,074 140,561 120,474 14 % 17 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Interest expense totaled $160 million in 2007 compared to $141 million in 2006 and $120 million in 2005. The growth in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, principally on our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $(15,904) (11,732) (8,944) 36 % 31 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Earnings in 2007 included a fourth quarter income tax benefit of $3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, associated primarily with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. 2006 Earnings in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings in 2006 included a one time, non cash pension accounting charge of $4 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted common share, to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations were $252 million, up 2% from $246 million in 2006. Comparable earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share were $4.21, up 6% from $3.99 in 2006. All business segments contributed to the improved results. The earnings growth was driven primarily by lower pension and safety and insurance costs and contractual revenue growth within our FMS business segment, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market in FMS for 2007. With the continuing improvements in earnings and cash flows over the past four years, we repurchased a total of 3.9 million shares of common stock in 2007 for $209 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 17% to $0.84 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2007, we acquired Pollock NationaLease and paid $75 million. Capital expenditures decreased to $1.19 billion compared with $1.76 billion in 2006. The reduction in capital expenditures reflects lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacements and expansion of customer fleets. Our debt decreased from $2.82 billion at December 31, 2006 to $2.78 billion at December 31, 2007 due to improved operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment offset by spending required to support the contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our debt to equity ratio also decreased to 147% from 164% in 2006. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio decreased to 157% from 168% in 2006. 2008 Outlook Our outlook for 2008 is positive, despite uncertainty of U.S. economic conditions. Our efforts will focus on the implementation of our contractual revenue growth strategies, including the evaluation of selective acquisitions, across all business segments while retaining financial discipline. Total revenue is targeted to decline by 6% while operating revenue is expected to increase by 5%. The 2008 forecast for total revenue includes the impact of net revenue reporting in 2008 for subcontracted transportation revenues previously reported on a gross basis. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition for additional information. We will also continue to focus on cost and safety management and process improvement actions that complement our growth strategies and establish a foundation for sustainable long term profitable growth. As a result, we expect earnings per diluted common share in 2008 to grow by 7% to 10% compared to 2007 comparable earnings per diluted common share. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased to $405 million in 2007 compared with $393 million in 2006, reflecting the benefits of (i) lower pension costs; (ii) contractual revenue growth in the FMS business segment (iii) lower safety and insurance costs; (iv) lower incentive based compensation; and (v) lower depreciation as a result of our annual depreciation review implemented January 1, 2007. Our 2007 NBT also benefited from a gain on sale of property of $10 million. These items more than offset the significant impact of weak U.S. commercial rental market demand and lower used vehicle sales results in our FMS business segment. Our 2006 NBT was impacted by a one time charge of $6 million to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $254 million in 2007 compared with $249 million in 2006. Earnings from continuing operations in 2007 included an income tax benefit of $3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due primarily to enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2007 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT increased to $393 million in 2006 compared with $357 million in 2005, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. The 2006 operating performance improvement was driven by contractual revenue growth in each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market on our FMS business segment results in the second half of 2006. Our 2006 NBT was impacted by a one time charge of $6 million to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million in 2006 compared with $228 million in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included a state income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes in the State of Ohio. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2006 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from increased lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2007 and 2006, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,776,999 2,735,752 2,587,733 2 % 6 Percentage of revenue 42% 43% 45% Operating expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense grew in 2006 principally as a result of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increase in operating expenses. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,410,388 1,397,391 1,262,160 1 % 11 Percentage of revenue 21% 22% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 31% 30% Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. The number of employees at December 31, 2007 increased to approximately 28,800 compared with 28,600 at December 31, 2006. Pension expense totaled $29 million in 2007 compared with $70 million in 2006. The decrease in 2007 pension expense is due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Pension expense in 2006 was also impacted by a pension accounting charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), which represented a one time, non cash charge to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations due to the removal of a substantive commitment. All other decreases to pension expense primarily impact our FMS business segment, which employs the majority of our employees who participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. See Note 23, Employee Benefit 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $21 million in 2008 because of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. However, we expect this decrease to be principally offset by our new enhanced 401(k) plan. Our 2008 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Our incentive based compensation program is comprised of annual cash incentive awards, amounts earned under discontinued cash based long term incentive plans and 401(k) company contributions which are based on the achievement of certain levels of financial performance generally over one fiscal year. The performance metrics and targets are based on internal business plans and center around operating revenue, earnings, earnings per share and return on capital. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in the current year. Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount, increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense also increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared to 2005. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $950,500 865,475 638,319 10 % 36 Percentage of revenue 14% 14% 11% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2007 and 2006, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we have determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, contract revenue associated with this portion of the subcontracted transportation contract totaled $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 815,962 743,288 740,415 10 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (44,094 ) (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (13 ) 8 Equipment rental 93,337 90,137 87,324 4 3 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from purchases during the past two years. In addition, adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale exceeded prior year levels by $18 million due to wholesale activity taken this year in light of increased average inventory levels. This 2007 activity does not reflect our long term expectations of residual values for revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 to $743 million compared to $740 million in 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases during 2006. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count. Both 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation is not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 and 2005 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007 and 2006. These residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared to 2006 and increased pre tax earnings for 2006 by approximately $13 million compared to 2005. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. The decrease was offset partially by a 21% increase in the number of vehicles sold in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on our used truck inventory at December 31, 2007, we expect the level of wholesale activity to decrease in 2008. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $160,074 140,561 120,474 14 % 17 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Interest expense totaled $160 million in 2007 compared to $141 million in 2006 and $120 million in 2005. The growth in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, principally on our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $(15,904) (11,732) (8,944) 36 % 31 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. The 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period.

See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2006 net retirement plan charges. As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Taxes (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other charges, net, the 2007 gain on sale of property described in Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, and certain 2006 net retirement plan charges described in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 405,464 392,973 357,088 3 % 10 Provision for income taxes 151,603 144,014 129,460 5 11 Earnings from continuing operations $ 253,861 248,959 227,628 2 % 9 Per diluted common share $ 4.24 4.04 3.53 5 % 14 Net earnings(1) $ 253,861 248,959 226,929 2 % 10 Per diluted common share $ 4.24 4.04 3.52 5 % 15 Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 59,845 61,578 64,560 (3 )% (5 ) (1) Net earnings for 2005 included (i) income from discontinued operations associated with the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations resulting in an after tax benefit of $2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and (ii) the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with the future removal of underground storage tanks resulting in an after tax charge of $2 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased to $405 million in 2007 compared with $393 million in 2006, reflecting the benefits of (i) lower pension costs; (ii) contractual revenue growth in the FMS business segment (iii) lower safety and insurance costs; (iv) lower incentive based compensation; and (v) lower depreciation as a result of our annual depreciation review implemented January 1, 2007. Our 2007 NBT also benefited from a gain on sale of property of $10 million. These items more than offset the significant impact of weak U.S. commercial rental market demand and lower used vehicle sales results in our FMS business segment. Our 2006 NBT was impacted by a one time charge of $6 million to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $254 million in 2007 compared with $249 million in 2006. Earnings from continuing operations in 2007 included an income tax benefit of $3 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due primarily to enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2007 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT increased to $393 million in 2006 compared with $357 million in 2005, reflecting better operating performance in all business segments. The 2006 operating performance improvement was driven by contractual revenue growth in each of our business segments, which more than offset the impact of a soft commercial rental market on our FMS business segment results in the second half of 2006. Our 2006 NBT was impacted by a one time charge of $6 million to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million in 2006 compared with $228 million in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations in 2006 included an income tax benefit of $7 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes due to enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in 2005 included a state income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, associated with the reduction of deferred income taxes in the State of Ohio. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2006 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 4,162,644 4,096,046 3,921,191 2 % 4 Supply Chain Solutions 2,250,282 2,028,489 1,637,826 11 24 Dedicated Contract Carriage 567,640 568,842 543,268 5 Eliminations (414,571 ) (386,734 ) (361,438 ) (7 ) (7 ) Total $ 6,565,995 6,306,643 5,740,847 4 % 10 Operating revenue(1) $ 4,636,557 4,454,231 4,210,881 4 % 6 (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from increased lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2007 and 2006, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,776,999 2,735,752 2,587,733 2 % 6 Percentage of revenue 42% 43% 45% Operating expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense grew in 2006 principally as a result of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increase in operating expenses. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,410,388 1,397,391 1,262,160 1 % 11 Percentage of revenue 21% 22% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 31% 30% Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. The number of employees at December 31, 2007 increased to approximately 28,800 compared with 28,600 at December 31, 2006. Pension expense totaled $29 million in 2007 compared with $70 million in 2006. The decrease in 2007 pension expense is due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Pension expense in 2006 was also impacted by a pension accounting charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), which represented a one time, non cash charge to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations due to the removal of a substantive commitment. All other decreases to pension expense primarily impact our FMS business segment, which employs the majority of our employees who participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. See Note 23, Employee Benefit 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $21 million in 2008 because of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. However, we expect this decrease to be principally offset by our new enhanced 401(k) plan. Our 2008 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Our incentive based compensation program is comprised of annual cash incentive awards, amounts earned under discontinued cash based long term incentive plans and 401(k) company contributions which are based on the achievement of certain levels of financial performance generally over one fiscal year. The performance metrics and targets are based on internal business plans and center around operating revenue, earnings, earnings per share and return on capital. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in the current year. Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount, increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense also increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared to 2005. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $950,500 865,475 638,319 10 % 36 Percentage of revenue 14% 14% 11% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2007 and 2006, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we have determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, contract revenue associated with this portion of the subcontracted transportation contract totaled $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 815,962 743,288 740,415 10 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (44,094 ) (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (13 ) 8 Equipment rental 93,337 90,137 87,324 4 3 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from purchases during the past two years. In addition, adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale exceeded prior year levels by $18 million due to wholesale activity taken this year in light of increased average inventory levels. This 2007 activity does not reflect our long term expectations of residual values for revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 to $743 million compared to $740 million in 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases during 2006. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count. Both 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation is not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 and 2005 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007 and 2006. These residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared to 2006 and increased pre tax earnings for 2006 by approximately $13 million compared to 2005. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. The decrease was offset partially by a 21% increase in the number of vehicles sold in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on our used truck inventory at December 31, 2007, we expect the level of wholesale activity to decrease in 2008. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $160,074 140,561 120,474 14 % 17 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Interest expense totaled $160 million in 2007 compared to $141 million in 2006 and $120 million in 2005. The growth in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, principally on our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $(15,904) (11,732) (8,944) 36 % 31 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. The 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,282 16,983 15,860 Dedicated Contract Carriage 14,966 16,749 16,800 Total $ 31,248 33,732 32,660 The following table provides a reconciliation of items excluded from our segment NBT measure to their classification within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings: Consolidated Statements of Earnings Years ended December 31 Description Line Item(1) 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Severance and employee related costs Restructuring $ (10,442 ) (1,048 ) (2,449 ) Facilities and related costs Restructuring (1,241 ) (194 ) (181 ) Early retirement of debt Restructuring (1,280 ) (2,141 ) Contract termination and transition costs Restructuring (306 ) (181 ) (746 ) Restructuring and other charges, net (13,269 ) (3,564 ) (3,376 ) Gain on sale of property(2) Misc.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 4,162,644 4,096,046 3,921,191 2 % 4 Supply Chain Solutions 2,250,282 2,028,489 1,637,826 11 24 Dedicated Contract Carriage 567,640 568,842 543,268 5 Eliminations (414,571 ) (386,734 ) (361,438 ) (7 ) (7 ) Total $ 6,565,995 6,306,643 5,740,847 4 % 10 Operating revenue(1) $ 4,636,557 4,454,231 4,210,881 4 % 6 (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. All business segments reported revenue growth in 2006. Revenue growth for FMS was driven by higher fuel services revenue, primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices from increased fuel costs, and higher full service lease revenue resulting from increased lease rates and new contract sales. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and higher volumes and new and expanded business. DCC revenue growth was due to expanded and new business as well as pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.8% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2007 and 2006, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,776,999 2,735,752 2,587,733 2 % 6 Percentage of revenue 42% 43% 45% Operating expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense grew in 2006 principally as a result of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increase in operating expenses. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,410,388 1,397,391 1,262,160 1 % 11 Percentage of revenue 21% 22% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 31% 30% Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. The number of employees at December 31, 2007 increased to approximately 28,800 compared with 28,600 at December 31, 2006. Pension expense totaled $29 million in 2007 compared with $70 million in 2006. The decrease in 2007 pension expense is due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Pension expense in 2006 was also impacted by a pension accounting charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), which represented a one time, non cash charge to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations due to the removal of a substantive commitment. All other decreases to pension expense primarily impact our FMS business segment, which employs the majority of our employees who participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. See Note 23, Employee Benefit 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $21 million in 2008 because of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. However, we expect this decrease to be principally offset by our new enhanced 401(k) plan. Our 2008 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Our incentive based compensation program is comprised of annual cash incentive awards, amounts earned under discontinued cash based long term incentive plans and 401(k) company contributions which are based on the achievement of certain levels of financial performance generally over one fiscal year. The performance metrics and targets are based on internal business plans and center around operating revenue, earnings, earnings per share and return on capital. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in the current year. Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount, increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense also increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared to 2005. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $950,500 865,475 638,319 10 % 36 Percentage of revenue 14% 14% 11% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2007 and 2006, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we have determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, contract revenue associated with this portion of the subcontracted transportation contract totaled $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 815,962 743,288 740,415 10 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (44,094 ) (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (13 ) 8 Equipment rental 93,337 90,137 87,324 4 3 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from purchases during the past two years. In addition, adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale exceeded prior year levels by $18 million due to wholesale activity taken this year in light of increased average inventory levels. This 2007 activity does not reflect our long term expectations of residual values for revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 to $743 million compared to $740 million in 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases during 2006. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count. Both 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation is not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 and 2005 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007 and 2006. These residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared to 2006 and increased pre tax earnings for 2006 by approximately $13 million compared to 2005. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. The decrease was offset partially by a 21% increase in the number of vehicles sold in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on our used truck inventory at December 31, 2007, we expect the level of wholesale activity to decrease in 2008. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $160,074 140,561 120,474 14 % 17 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Interest expense totaled $160 million in 2007 compared to $141 million in 2006 and $120 million in 2005. The growth in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, principally on our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2007 and 2006, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,776,999 2,735,752 2,587,733 2 % 6 Percentage of revenue 42% 43% 45% Operating expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense grew in 2006 principally as a result of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The revenue growth from each business segment, excluding fuel, also contributed to the increase in operating expenses. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,410,388 1,397,391 1,262,160 1 % 11 Percentage of revenue 21% 22% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 31% 30% Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. The number of employees at December 31, 2007 increased to approximately 28,800 compared with 28,600 at December 31, 2006. Pension expense totaled $29 million in 2007 compared with $70 million in 2006. The decrease in 2007 pension expense is due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Pension expense in 2006 was also impacted by a pension accounting charge of $6 million ($4 million after tax), which represented a one time, non cash charge to properly account for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. The impact of this one time charge was partially offset by a reduction of our 2006 pension expense of $5 million ($3 million after tax) resulting from the interim remeasurement of plan assets and pension obligations due to the removal of a substantive commitment. All other decreases to pension expense primarily impact our FMS business segment, which employs the majority of our employees who participate in the primary U.S. pension plan. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. See Note 23, Employee Benefit 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $21 million in 2008 because of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. However, we expect this decrease to be principally offset by our new enhanced 401(k) plan. Our 2008 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Our incentive based compensation program is comprised of annual cash incentive awards, amounts earned under discontinued cash based long term incentive plans and 401(k) company contributions which are based on the achievement of certain levels of financial performance generally over one fiscal year. The performance metrics and targets are based on internal business plans and center around operating revenue, earnings, earnings per share and return on capital. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in the current year. Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount, increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense also increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared to 2005. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $950,500 865,475 638,319 10 % 36 Percentage of revenue 14% 14% 11% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2007 and 2006, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we have determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, contract revenue associated with this portion of the subcontracted transportation contract totaled $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 815,962 743,288 740,415 10 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (44,094 ) (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (13 ) 8 Equipment rental 93,337 90,137 87,324 4 3 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from purchases during the past two years. In addition, adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale exceeded prior year levels by $18 million due to wholesale activity taken this year in light of increased average inventory levels. This 2007 activity does not reflect our long term expectations of residual values for revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 to $743 million compared to $740 million in 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases during 2006. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count. Both 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation is not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 and 2005 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007 and 2006. These residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared to 2006 and increased pre tax earnings for 2006 by approximately $13 million compared to 2005. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. The decrease was offset partially by a 21% increase in the number of vehicles sold in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on our used truck inventory at December 31, 2007, we expect the level of wholesale activity to decrease in 2008. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $160,074 140,561 120,474 14 % 17 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Interest expense totaled $160 million in 2007 compared to $141 million in 2006 and $120 million in 2005. The growth in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, principally on our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease approximately $21 million in 2008 because of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. However, we expect this decrease to be principally offset by our new enhanced 401(k) plan. Our 2008 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Our incentive based compensation program is comprised of annual cash incentive awards, amounts earned under discontinued cash based long term incentive plans and 401(k) company contributions which are based on the achievement of certain levels of financial performance generally over one fiscal year. The performance metrics and targets are based on internal business plans and center around operating revenue, earnings, earnings per share and return on capital. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in the current year. Salaries and employee related costs and salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of added headcount, increased outside labor costs to support the growth in our SCS and DCC business segments, higher share based compensation and higher employee benefit costs. Average headcount increased 4% in 2006 compared with 2005. Additionally, on January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R and recognized $10 million of additional share based compensation expense in 2006. See Note 22, Share Based Compensation Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense also increased $11 million in 2006 to $70 million compared to 2005. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $950,500 865,475 638,319 10 % 36 Percentage of revenue 14% 14% 11% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. During 2007 and 2006, subcontracted transportation expense in our SCS business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we have determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, contract revenue associated with this portion of the subcontracted transportation contract totaled $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $ 815,962 743,288 740,415 10 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (44,094 ) (50,766 ) (47,098 ) (13 ) 8 Equipment rental 93,337 90,137 87,324 4 3 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from purchases during the past two years. In addition, adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale exceeded prior year levels by $18 million due to wholesale activity taken this year in light of increased average inventory levels. This 2007 activity does not reflect our long term expectations of residual values for revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 to $743 million compared to $740 million in 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases during 2006. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count. Both 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation is not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 and 2005 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007 and 2006. These residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared to 2006 and increased pre tax earnings for 2006 by approximately $13 million compared to 2005. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. The decrease was offset partially by a 21% increase in the number of vehicles sold in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on our used truck inventory at December 31, 2007, we expect the level of wholesale activity to decrease in 2008. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $160,074 140,561 120,474 14 % 17 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Interest expense totaled $160 million in 2007 compared to $141 million in 2006 and $120 million in 2005. The growth in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, principally on our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $(15,904) (11,732) (8,944) 36 % 31 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $151,603 144,014 129,460 5 % 11 Effective tax rate 37.4% 36.6% 36.3% The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. The 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period.

See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2006 net retirement plan charges. As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Taxes (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other charges, net, the 2007 gain on sale of property described in Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, and certain 2006 net retirement plan charges described in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ Number of Units 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 900 4,200 1,700 (79 )% 147 No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale(1) 5,400 6,600 5,500 (18 ) 20 Other NLE units 1,000 1,900 1,400 (47 ) 36 Total(2) 7,300 12,700 8,600 (43 )% 48 (1) Total units held for sale in the U.S., including those that earned revenue in the previous 30 days, were 6,400 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 7,600 vehicles at December 31, 2006 and 6,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005. (2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 46 47) of PART II of this report. 55 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from purchases during the past two years. In addition, adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale exceeded prior year levels by $18 million due to wholesale activity taken this year in light of increased average inventory levels. This 2007 activity does not reflect our long term expectations of residual values for revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased slightly in 2006 to $743 million compared to $740 million in 2005, reflecting the impact of a higher average vehicle investment on purchases during 2006. These changes were partially offset by the impact of a lower average fleet count. Both 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation is not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 and 2005 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007 and 2006. These residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared to 2006 and increased pre tax earnings for 2006 by approximately $13 million compared to 2005. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. The decrease was offset partially by a 21% increase in the number of vehicles sold in 2007 compared with 2006. Based on our used truck inventory at December 31, 2007, we expect the level of wholesale activity to decrease in 2008. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to improved average pricing on vehicles sold, which more than offset the decline in the number of vehicles sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $160,074 140,561 120,474 14 % 17 Effective interest rate 5.6% 5.7% 5.6% Interest expense totaled $160 million in 2007 compared to $141 million in 2006 and $120 million in 2005. The growth in interest expense reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, principally on our contractual full service lease business, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $(15,904) (11,732) (8,944) 36 % 31 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and other non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of a $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. See Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Miscellaneous income, net for 2007 also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in the current year compared to an unfavorable settlement in the prior year. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared to 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment) and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Miscellaneous income, net increased to $12 million in 2006 compared to $9 million in 2005 due to the previously mentioned 2006 $3 million business interruption insurance claim and $2 million recovery for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies, as well as better market performance of investments classified as trading securities. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by a $1 million 2006 charge related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation, as well as the 2005 one time recovery of $3 million of project costs incurred in prior years. Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 13,269 3,564 3,376 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $11 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $1 million of facility and related costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). We expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of up to $25 million from these initiatives once all employee severance actions have been completed. Most severance actions will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $20 million of cost savings is expected to be realized in 2008. Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. We expect to realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and facility charges. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realize annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates.

The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. The 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $8 million associated with the State of Ohio enacted tax legislation, which phases out the Ohio corporate franchise tax and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) over a five year period.

See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2006 net retirement plan charges. As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Taxes (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other charges, net, the 2007 gain on sale of property described in Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, and certain 2006 net retirement plan charges described in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and facility charges recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. 2005 Activity During 2005, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 160 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in our domestic and international FMS and SCS business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $3 million. Cost reductions associated with these actions benefited salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by the decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources. We also closed two administrative offices in the U.S. as a result of the restructuring of our FMS domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations. Also in 2005, management approved and committed to a plan to transition certain outsourced telecommunication services to Ryder employees. In accordance with the terms of this service agreement, we notified the information technology services provider of our intent to terminate the services and recorded charges totaling nearly $1 million for contract termination costs. In 2006, the transition activities were completed and cost reductions associated with the termination of these services benefited operating expenses in the latter part of 2006. These charges were partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals due to refinements in estimates. See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below.

Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2006 net retirement plan charges. As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Net Before Taxes (NBT), which includes an allocation of CSS and excludes restructuring and other charges, net, the 2007 gain on sale of property described in Note 9, Operating Property and Equipment, and certain 2006 net retirement plan charges described in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below.

Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Contractual revenue growth was realized in both FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons to continue in the near term due to recent acquisitions and increased contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average U.S. rental fleet size declined 10% in 2007 compared to 2006. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons to improve from 2007 levels as our fleet count has stabilized. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 259,723 282,528 296,435 (8 )% (5 ) Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 210,657 277,461 284,187 (24 )% (2 ) Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 29,600 32,800 33,900 (10 )% (3 ) Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 21,100 24,100 24,200 (12 )% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.0% 71.9% 74.6% (90 ) bps (270 ) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales results in 2007 were impacted by higher carrying costs on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. FMS NBT was negatively impacted by $25 million in 2007 because of higher valuation adjustments and lower gains on sale. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation policy change effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation of $4 million compared to 2006. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves of $11 million compared to $3 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue grew 4% in 2006 reflecting higher fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices. Operating revenue increased 2% to $2.92 billion in 2006 compared to $2.86 billion in 2005 due to full service lease growth primarily in North America. Total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.3%. Contractual revenue growth in 2006 was realized in both FMS product lines. Full service lease revenue grew 4% due to higher lease rates and higher levels of sales activity in North America. Contract maintenance revenue increased 6% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 3% in 2006 reflecting a smaller average fleet and lower vehicle utilization from a weakening U.S. commercial rental market. FMS NBT grew $14 million in 2006 primarily as a result of higher contractual revenue. The favorable impact of contractual revenue growth was partially offset by reduced commercial rental volumes, higher sales and marketing expenses, compensation related expenses and higher interest expense due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investments in the full service lease business, pension contributions and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ Number of Units 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 900 4,200 1,700 (79 )% 147 No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale(1) 5,400 6,600 5,500 (18 ) 20 Other NLE units 1,000 1,900 1,400 (47 ) 36 Total(2) 7,300 12,700 8,600 (43 )% 48 (1) Total units held for sale in the U.S., including those that earned revenue in the previous 30 days, were 6,400 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 7,600 vehicles at December 31, 2006 and 6,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005. (2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ Number of Units 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 900 4,200 1,700 (79 )% 147 No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale(1) 5,400 6,600 5,500 (18 ) 20 Other NLE units 1,000 1,900 1,400 (47 ) 36 Total(2) 7,300 12,700 8,600 (43 )% 48 (1) Total units held for sale in the U.S., including those that earned revenue in the previous 30 days, were 6,400 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 7,600 vehicles at December 31, 2006 and 6,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005. (2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the table above include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Years ended December 31 Change 2007/ 2006/ Number of Units 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 900 4,200 1,700 (79 )% 147 No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale(1) 5,400 6,600 5,500 (18 ) 20 Other NLE units 1,000 1,900 1,400 (47 ) 36 Total(2) 7,300 12,700 8,600 (43 )% 48 (1) Total units held for sale in the U.S., including those that earned revenue in the previous 30 days, were 6,400 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 7,600 vehicles at December 31, 2006 and 6,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005. (2) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, 1,700 at December 31, 2006 and 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2005, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2007, the number of NYE units decreased compared to prior year consistent with the reduced volume of lease sales and replacement activity. NLE units represent vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, held for sale, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2007, the number of NLE units decreased compared to the prior year because of increased commercial rental utilization, especially in the second half of 2007, and increased wholesale activity to reduce inventory levels. We expect the number of NLE units to decline in the near term as the number of rental units being outserviced and the level of lease replacement activity slows during 2008. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively, in 2007, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue in the near term, although the percentage improvement is expected to decline from current levels. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted by a change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 is mainly due to $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $4 million in 2006. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 2006 versus 2005 SCS total revenue grew 24% in 2006 due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, higher customer volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, Canada and Latin America. Operating revenue grew 16% in 2006. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In 2006, our largest customer, GM, accounted for approximately 40% of SCS total revenue and 18% of SCS operating revenue. SCS NBT improved $23 million in 2006 as a result of the impact of higher volumes, new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups, better margins in our Brazil operations and lower safety and insurance costs. In 2006, SCS NBT was also favorably impacted by a contract termination totaling $3 million, net of variable compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 is mainly due to $4 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $2 million in 2005.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2007 versus 2006 Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. Total revenue was flat in 2007 compared to 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

Current year CSS costs were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2007 includes $7 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $6 million in 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Total revenue and operating revenue grew 5% and 4%, respectively, in 2006 as a result of expanded and new business in the first half of 2006, as well as pricing increases associated with higher average fuel costs. DCC NBT improved $7 million in 2006 due to new and expanded business as well as lower safety and insurance costs of $4 million, including a hurricane related recovery. The decrease in safety and insurance costs in 2006 includes $6 million of favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves compared to $3 million in 2005.

These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 2006 versus 2005 Total CSS costs in 2006 decreased because of (i) lower information technology costs from ongoing cost containment initiatives; (ii) a one time recovery of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year; and (iii) lower spending in corporate services as the prior year included costs associated with the relocation of our headquarters facility. These decreases were slightly offset by higher share based compensation from expensing stock options and litigation settlement costs associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2006 primarily as a result of higher share based compensation expense. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Financing activities (299,203 ) 488,202 241,505 Investing activities (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) (988,855 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7,303 (2,327 ) (3,956 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (12,180 ) (88 ) 27,756 A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared with $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006 compared with 2005, because of higher cash based earnings and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by higher pension contributions of $117 million. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by U.S. federal income tax payments of $176 million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the 1998 to 2000 tax period. Income tax payments in 2006 also included $85 million deferred from 2005 due to hurricane relief provisions enacted in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $488 million compared with $242 million in 2005. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects higher debt borrowings used to fund increased vehicle capital spending, higher pension contributions and share repurchases. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.34 billion in 2006 compared with $989 million in 2005, due to higher vehicle capital spending, principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets, and an increase in restricted cash associated with the implementation of the vehicle like kind exchange tax program in 2006. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,102,939 853,587 779,062 Sales of revenue earning equipment 354,767 326,079 326,752 Sales of operating property and equipment 18,868 6,575 6,963 Collections on direct finance leases 63,358 66,274 70,408 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,691,868 1,254,678 1,183,185 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) (1,399,379 ) Free cash flow $ 374,632 (440,386 ) (216,194 ) Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, a sale leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. Free cash flow decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increased vehicle capital spending and higher pension contributions. We anticipate positive but lower free cash flow in 2008 as a result of increased anticipated vehicle capital spending and no planned sale and leaseback transactions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, and warehouse facilities and equipment. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment:(1) Full service lease $ 900,028 1,492,720 1,082,332 Commercial rental 218,830 195,023 251,278 1,118,858 1,687,743 1,333,610 Operating property and equipment 75,978 71,772 77,360 Total capital expenditures 1,194,836 1,759,515 1,410,970 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 122,400 (64,451 ) (11,591 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,317,236 1,695,064 1,399,379 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $11 million, $2 million and $0.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Capital expenditures grew in 2006 because of increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. Vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from 2001 to 2003 as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers, redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet. Accordingly, capital spending levels were relatively higher from 2004 to 2006 because of increased replacement activity. We also experienced increased replacement activity in 2006 associated with the introduction in 2007 of emission after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.44 billion in 2008 as a result of higher planned levels of spending for full service lease vehicles. We expect to fund 2008 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. In 2007, we completed an acquisition in Canada related to the FMS and SCS segments. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On January 11, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Lily Transportation Corporation (Lily) for a purchase price of $95 million. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in FMS, SCS and DCC in 2008. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, bank credit facilities and commercial paper. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,816,943 2,185,366 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (159,771 ) 328,641 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 250,000 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 263,021 120,568 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (263,021 ) (213,195 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (175,979 ) (165,324 ) (85,750 ) 620,690 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (96 ) (663 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,920 2,295 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 34,112 9,255 Total changes in debt (40,814 ) 631,577 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 31% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2007 of Equity 2006 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,776,129 147% $ 2,816,943 164% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 177,992 77,998 Total obligations $ 2,954,121 157% $ 2,894,941 168% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. Our leverage ratios decreased in 2007, as improved operating cash flows were used to reduce outstanding debt. Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment also served to reduce balance sheet debt levels. These improved operating cash flows more than offset the spending required to support our 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contractual full service lease business and share repurchase programs. Our long term target range of total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating. We believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets is supported by long term customer leases. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11.0 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on our current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2007 was 127%. At December 31, 2007, $295 million was available under the credit facility (net of commercial paper backup requirements and outstanding foreign subsidiary borrowings outstanding). Foreign borrowings of $46 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2007. Commercial paper is supported by the long term global revolving credit facility. Our intent is to continue to renew the revolving credit facility on a long term basis, subject to market conditions. As a result, the commercial paper borrowings supported by the long term revolving credit facility are classified as long term debt. On February 27, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The automatic shelf registration replaced our $800 million shelf registration statement, which was fully utilized with the issuance of $250 million of medium term notes in February 2007 maturing in March 2014. During 2006, we issued $550 million of medium term notes, of which $250 million mature in May 2011 and $300 million mature in November 2016. The proceeds from the medium term notes were used for general corporate purposes. Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder has a Trade Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Trade Receivables Agreement) with two financial institutions. Under this program, Ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to RRF LLC that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and (or) committed purchasers. Under the terms of the program, RRF LLC and Ryder have provided representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs, notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper. This program is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement. The available proceeds that may be received by RRF LLC under the program are limited to $200 million. RRF LLCs costs under this program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 9, 2008. At December 31, 2007, there was $100 million outstanding under the agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 2006. In January 2008, we increased our limit under this program to $300 million. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2007, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $295 Trade receivables program 100 Automatic shelf registration Indeterminate Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. Market conditions will also impact our borrowing costs. Based on current market conditions, we have evaluated our ability to access the unsecured debt market and believe that we have the ability to issue unsecured debt. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would reduce our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on our other established short term funding sources. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (April 2005) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registration with the SEC and the trade receivables program will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. In addition to the unsecured sources of funding available to us, we could also meet our financing needs with asset based securitization and sale leaseback transactions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. This lease contains limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2006 and 2005. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $17 million, respectively, and we have accrued $2 million in each period, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 220,483 1,087,368 734,139 721,297 2,763,287 Capital lease obligations 2,215 3,378 2,615 4,634 12,842 Total debt 222,698 1,090,746 736,754 725,931 2,776,129 Interest on debt(1) 146,569 236,398 126,742 230,708 740,417 Operating leases(2) 97,451 163,872 119,018 91,306 471,647 Purchase obligations(3) 241,558 25,938 1,241 149 268,886 Total contractual cash obligations 485,578 426,208 247,001 322,163 1,480,950 Insurance obligations(4) 119,280 102,635 42,477 33,777 298,169 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 15,803 5,432 1,420 50,716 73,371 Total $ 843,359 1,625,021 1,027,652 1,132,587 4,628,619 (1) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2007. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (2) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (3) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (4) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2008, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $22 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2008 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next five years is approximately $21 million (pre tax) for the U.S. plan (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $75 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 46 47) of PART II of this report. 55 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan. Due to the fact that our pension plan was replaced by an enhanced 401(k) plan to which we will also be contributing, we do not believe our benefit plan funding requirements will change significantly as a result of the freeze of the U.S. pension plans. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $148 million and $201 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduced equity charge in 2007 reflects our improved funded status as a result of (i) an increase in interest rates; (ii) pension asset returns; (iii) pension contributions; and (iv) the impact of the freeze of U.S. pension plans. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were 6% in 2007. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2007, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $60 million compared with $130 million in 2006. After considering the 2007 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated contributions for our U.S. plan that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $21 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during 2007 could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2008 and beyond. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law. The major provisions of the statute took effect January 1, 2008. Among other things, the statute is designed to ensure timely and adequate funding of qualified pension plans by shortening the time period within which employers must fully fund pension benefits. Due to the funded status of our primary pension plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will not have a significant impact on our future pension funding requirements. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors also authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. Under the anti dilutive program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the lesser of the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through the employee stock purchase plan for the period from September 1, 2007 to December 12, 2009, or 2 million shares. Share repurchases of common stock under both plans may be made periodically in open market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish a prearranged written plan for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2007 programs, which would allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. During 2007, no repurchases had been made under these programs. In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2007. We repurchased and retired approximately 3.7 million shares under the May 2007 program at an aggregate cost of $200 million. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In May 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The May 2006 program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. This program was competed during the first quarter of 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we repurchased and retired approximately 0.2 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, under the May 2006 program at an aggregate cost of $9 million and $93 million, respectively. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a $175 million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares and 2.6 million shares, respectively, under the October 2005 program at an aggregate cost of $66 million and $109 million, respectively. In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.1 million shares under the July 2004 program at an aggregate cost of $43 million. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $50 million in 2007, $44 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. During 2007, we increased our annual dividend to $0.84 per share of common stock. In February 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. The dividend reflects a $0.02 increase from the $0.21 per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in 2007. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, we had $2.00 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2007 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $31 million. At December 31, 2006, we had $1.95 billion of fixed rate debt (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.93 billion, including the effects of an interest rate swap which matured in September 2007 and October 2007. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2006 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $37 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was recorded as an asset and was not material. We estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations. At December 31, 2007, we had $767 million of variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2006, we had $865 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $35 million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. Changes in the fair value of the interest 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (pages 46 47) of PART II of this report. 55 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2006 was recorded as an asset totaling $0.1 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $4 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, at December 31, 2006, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of $20 million. The cross currency swap matured in 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the potential loss in fair value of our cross currency swap and forward foreign currency exchange contracts would have been $10 million. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2007, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products, primarily diesel fuel, regulated under environmental protection laws. These laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment. In response to these requirements, we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination. Capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in each of 2006 and 2005. We incurred environmental expenses of $7 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing, testing and waste disposal fees. Based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations, environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from 2007 levels in the near term. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations to comparable earnings from continuing 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors, primarily the level of contamination, the effectiveness of selected remediation methods, the stage of managements investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties. Based upon information presently available, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. See Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2007, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2008 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2008 by approximately $88 million. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) operating lease agreements at December 31, 2007, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2008 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined benefit plans covering most employees. These plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. The composition of our pension assets was 75% equity securities and 25% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had an actuarial loss of $238 million at the end of 2007 compared with a loss of $318 million at the end of 2006. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2007 resulted primarily from actuarial gains associated with an increase in discount rates. To the extent the amount of all actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Our amortization period has historically been based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, the amortization period for the actuarial loss on the qualified U.S. pension plan will be based on the average remaining life expectancy of these participants (29 years) resulting in an extended amortization period beginning in 2008. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2008 will be $86 million. The effect on years beyond 2008 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2007 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of these accounting standards. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) A sensitivity analysis of projected 2008 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2008 Net December 31, 2007 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.00% + 0.25% $1 million $36 million Discount rate decrease 6.00% 0.25% + $1 million + $36 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.50% +/ 0.25% /+ $3 million Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00% +/ 0.50% +/ $1 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $278 million and $283 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared to historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded a benefit of $24 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2007, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2008 by approximately $13 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements, useful lives and discount rates. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. For example, the profitability and valuation of fair value for our SCS U.K. reporting unit is dependent in large part to several significant customer contracts. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2007, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. At December 31, 2007, goodwill totaled $167 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Audits of our U.S. federal income tax returns are closed through fiscal year 2003. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2005 we resolved all issues with the IRS related to the 1998 to 2000 tax period, including interest and penalties. In connection with the resolution of this audit, on February 22, 2005 we paid $176 million (after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards), including interest through the date of payment. We believe that we have not entered into any other transactions since 2000 that raise the same type of issues identified by the IRS in the audit of the 1998 to 2000 tax period.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) our ability to successfully achieve the operational goals that are the basis of our business strategies, including offering competitive pricing, diversifying our customer base, optimizing asset utilization, leveraging the expertise of our various business segments, serving our customers global needs and expanding our support services; impact of losses from conditional obligations arising from guarantees; our expectations as to the future level of vehicle wholesaling activity; number of NLE vehicles in inventory, and the size of our commercial rental fleet, for the remainder of the year; estimates of free cash flow, capital expenditures and environmental expenses for 2008; the adequacy of our accounting estimates and reserves for pension expense, depreciation and residual value guarantees, self insurance reserves, goodwill impairment, accounting changes and income taxes; our ability to fund all of our operations for the foreseeable future through internally generated funds and outside funding sources; the anticipated impact of fuel price fluctuations; our expectations as to future pension expense and contributions, the impact of recent pension legislation, as well as the effect of the freeze of the U.S. pension plan on our benefit funding requirements; the anticipated income tax impact of the like kind exchange program; the anticipated deferral of tax gains on disposal of eligible revenue earning equipment pursuant to our vehicle like kind exchange program; our expectations as to the future effect of amendments to our contractual relationship with GM; and our expectations regarding the effect of the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements. These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in the Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we will be acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense will decrease in the future due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million, $565 million and $360 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $207 million and $250 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $15 million and $13 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made.
