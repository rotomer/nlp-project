ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. The following MDA describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations, and critical accounting estimates. OVERVIEW Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our business is divided into three business segments, which operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, electronics, transportation, grocery, lumber and wood products, food service, and home furnishing. The Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing, contract maintenance, contract related maintenance, and commercial rental of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. FMS revenue and assets in 2008 were $4.01 billion and $6.14 billion, respectively, representing 65% of our consolidated revenue and 92% of consolidated assets. The Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting including distribution and transportation services throughout North America and in South America, Europe and Asia. SCS revenue in 2008 was $1.64 billion, representing 26% of our consolidated revenue. The Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S. DCC revenue in 2008 was $548 million, representing 9% of our consolidated revenue. 2008 was a year of significant accomplishments for us, as we delivered strong earnings, operating revenue growth and positive free cash flow following more than two full years of a U.S. freight recession. We also successfully completed four accretive acquisitions in 2008. However, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we saw significant deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly affecting our transactional commercial rental business. In December 2008, we announced several strategic actions, including discontinuing certain operations and workforce reductions, that will better position us for the market conditions we anticipate in the upcoming year. Total revenue was $6.20 billion, down 6% from $6.57 billion in 2007. Revenue comparisons were impacted by a previously announced change from gross to net revenue reporting in a subcontracted transportation agreement, which had no impact on operating revenue or earnings. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue (total revenue less fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $4.70 billion in 2008, up 1%. Operating revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue, including acquisitions in our FMS business segment, new and expanded business in SCS partially offset by lower commercial rental revenue. Net earnings decreased to $200 million from $254 million in 2007 and net earnings per diluted common share decreased to $3.52 from $4.24 in 2007. Net earnings included certain items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations and have been excluded from our comparable earnings measure. The 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) following discussion provides a summary of the 2008 and 2007 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MDA and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: NBT Net Earnings EPS (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2008 Earnings / EPS $ 349,922 $ 199,881 $ 3.52 Restructuring and other charges primarily related to exit costs associated with a previously announced plan to discontinue certain international supply chain operations and workforce reductions 58,435 53,159 0.94 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (7,931 ) (0.14 ) Benefit from a tax law change in Massachusetts (1,614 ) (0.03 ) Brazil charges for prior years adjustments(1) 6,498 6,831 0.12 Charges related to impairments and write offs of international assets(1) 5,548 4,427 0.08 Comparable earnings $ 420,403 $ 254,753 $ 4.49 2007 Earnings / EPS $ 405,464 $ 253,861 $ 4.24 Benefit from tax law changes in Canada (3,333 ) (0.06 ) Gain on sale of property(1) (10,110 ) (6,154 ) (0.10 ) Restructuring and other charges related to cost management and process improvement actions 11,578 7,536 0.13 Comparable earnings $ 406,932 $ 251,910 $ 4.21 (1) Refer to Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable net earnings were $255 million, up 1% from $252 million in 2007. Comparable earnings per diluted common share were $4.49, up 7% from $4.21 in 2007. Earnings growth in the FMS and DCC business segments was largely offset by a decline in SCS earnings. With our strong earnings and cash flows, we repurchased a total of 4 million shares of common stock in 2008 for $256 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 10% to $0.92 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2008, we paid $246 million and acquired the assets of Lily Transportation, Gator Leasing, Gordon Truck Leasing and Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. Capital expenditures increased to $1.27 billion compared to $1.19 billion in 2007. The growth in capital expenditures reflects higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacements and expansion of customer fleets. Our debt balances grew 3% to $2.86 billion at December 31, 2008 due to acquisitions and share repurchase programs. Our debt to equity ratio also increased to 213% from 147% in 2007. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also increased to 225% from 157% in 2007. Leverage ratios were impacted by the unrecognized pension plan losses, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 2009 Outlook In 2009, we plan to manage through the impacts of a prolonged economic recession by focusing our efforts on the cyclical impacts in commercial rental and used vehicle sales and concentrating on cost improvement actions. We expect 2009 comparable earnings per diluted common share to decline because of 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) higher pension expense, lower commercial rental and used vehicle sales results and lower volumes, particularly in the automotive industry. We expect to partially offset these negative impacts through cost reduction initiatives, operational improvements and the carryover impact of acquisitions and share repurchases. In 2009, we will continue to focus on our contractual revenue growth and retention strategies, including the evaluation of selective acquisitions, while retaining financial discipline. Total revenue is targeted to decrease by 10% to 16% while operating revenue is expected to decrease by 5% to 11%. The 2009 forecast for total revenue includes the adverse impact of lower anticipated fuel prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Revenue Reporting In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. This contract modification required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation beginning on January 1, 2008. This contract represented $640 million and $565 million of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS We have completed various asset purchase agreements in the past two years, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition.

This strategic acquisition adds complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Earnings before income taxes $ 349,922 405,464 392,973 (14)% 3% Provision for income taxes 150,041 151,603 144,014 (1) 5 Net earnings $ 199,881 253,861 248,959 (21)% 2% Per diluted common share $ 3.52 4.24 4.04 (17)% 5% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 56,790 59,845 61,578 (5)% (3)% Earnings before income taxes (NBT) decreased to $350 million in 2008 compared to $405 million in 2007. NBT in 2008 included a fourth quarter restructuring charge primarily associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe. Comparable NBT increased to $420 million compared to $407 million in the prior year. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased to $200 million in 2008 or $3.52. Net earnings in 2008 included income tax benefits primarily related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions. Comparable net earnings increased to $255 million or $4.49 in 2008 from $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 due to the improvement in NBT. This improvement was slightly offset by a higher tax rate on comparable earnings resulting from an increase in non deductible foreign losses. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2008 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT increased to $405 million in 2007 compared to $393 million in 2006. NBT in 2007 included restructuring charges and a gain on the sale of property. Comparable NBT increased to $407 million compared to $399 million in 2006 reflecting the benefits of (i) lower pension costs; (ii) contractual revenue growth in the FMS business segment; (iii) lower safety and insurance costs; (iv) lower incentive based compensation; and (v) lower depreciation as a result of our annual depreciation review implemented January 1, 2007. These items more than offset the significant impact of weak U.S. commercial rental market demand and lower used vehicle sales results in our FMS business segment. Net earnings increased to $254 million in 2007 compared to $249 million in 2006. Net earnings in 2007 included an income tax benefit primarily associated with enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. Net earnings in 2006 included an income tax benefit associated with enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Comparable net earnings increased to $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 from $246 million or $3.99 in 2006. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2007 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) See subsequent discussion within Full Year Consolidated Results and Full Year Operating Results by Business Segment for additional information on the results noted above. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 4,450,016 4,162,644 4,096,046 7% 2% Supply Chain Solutions 1,643,056 2,250,282 2,028,489 (27) 11 Dedicated Contract Carriage 547,751 567,640 568,842 (4) Eliminations (437,080 ) (414,571 ) (386,734 ) (5) (7) Total $ 6,203,743 6,565,995 6,306,643 (6)% 4% Operating revenue(1) $ 4,704,506 4,636,557 4,454,231 1% 4% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.20 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 1% primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2008 and 2007, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $3,029,673 2,776,999 2,735,752 9% 2% Percentage of revenue 49% 42% 43% Operating expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007 from the impact of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. We continue to realize favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves and as a result benefited from lower safety and insurance costs. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. Operating expense increased in 2007 compared with 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,399,121 1,410,388 1,397,391 (1)% 1% Percentage of revenue 23% 21% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. The number of employees at December 31, 2008 decreased to approximately 28,000 compared to 28,800 at December 31, 2007. We expect headcount to decline in 2009 due to the previously announced strategic initiatives. Pension expense totaled $3 million in 2008 compared to $29 million in 2007. Lower pension expense was primarily a result of the freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. During the third quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the freeze of the defined benefit portion of the Canadian retirement plan, which resulted in a curtailment gain of $4 million. In connection with the freeze of the pension plans, we provided an enhanced 401(k) savings plan to employees. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Total savings plan costs increased $20 million during 2008 primarily as a result of the enhanced 401(k) plan. The net impact of pension and savings plan costs was a net decrease of $6 million for 2008 compared with 2007. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors, such as discount rate and the expected 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) long term rate of return on assets. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the current year effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience. We have experienced significant negative pension asset returns in 2008 the result of which will materially increase pension expense for 2009. We expect 2009 pension expense, on a pre tax basis, to increase approximately $62 million primarily because of a lower than expected return on assets in 2008 partially offset by higher discount rates. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Pension expense decreased $41 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $323,382 950,500 865,475 (66)% 10% Percentage of revenue 5% 14% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Subcontracted transportation expense in 2007 grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $843,459 815,962 743,288 3% 10% Gains on vehicle sales, net (39,312) (44,094) (50,766) (11) (13) Equipment rental 80,105 93,337 90,137 (14) 4 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $843 million in 2008 compared to $816 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. The increases were partially offset by lower adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from increased capital spending and higher adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $157,257 160,074 140,561 (2)% 14% Effective interest rate 5.5% 5.6% 5.7% Interest expense totaled $157 million in 2008 compared to $160 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous expense (income), net $ 1,735 (15,904 ) (11,732 ) (111)% 36% Miscellaneous expense (income), net consists of investment losses (income) on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, losses (gains) from sales of property, foreign currency transaction losses (gains), and non operating items. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates.

The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) following discussion provides a summary of the 2008 and 2007 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MDA and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: NBT Net Earnings EPS (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2008 Earnings / EPS $ 349,922 $ 199,881 $ 3.52 Restructuring and other charges primarily related to exit costs associated with a previously announced plan to discontinue certain international supply chain operations and workforce reductions 58,435 53,159 0.94 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (7,931 ) (0.14 ) Benefit from a tax law change in Massachusetts (1,614 ) (0.03 ) Brazil charges for prior years adjustments(1) 6,498 6,831 0.12 Charges related to impairments and write offs of international assets(1) 5,548 4,427 0.08 Comparable earnings $ 420,403 $ 254,753 $ 4.49 2007 Earnings / EPS $ 405,464 $ 253,861 $ 4.24 Benefit from tax law changes in Canada (3,333 ) (0.06 ) Gain on sale of property(1) (10,110 ) (6,154 ) (0.10 ) Restructuring and other charges related to cost management and process improvement actions 11,578 7,536 0.13 Comparable earnings $ 406,932 $ 251,910 $ 4.21 (1) Refer to Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable net earnings were $255 million, up 1% from $252 million in 2007. Comparable earnings per diluted common share were $4.49, up 7% from $4.21 in 2007. Earnings growth in the FMS and DCC business segments was largely offset by a decline in SCS earnings. With our strong earnings and cash flows, we repurchased a total of 4 million shares of common stock in 2008 for $256 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 10% to $0.92 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2008, we paid $246 million and acquired the assets of Lily Transportation, Gator Leasing, Gordon Truck Leasing and Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. Capital expenditures increased to $1.27 billion compared to $1.19 billion in 2007. The growth in capital expenditures reflects higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacements and expansion of customer fleets. Our debt balances grew 3% to $2.86 billion at December 31, 2008 due to acquisitions and share repurchase programs. Our debt to equity ratio also increased to 213% from 147% in 2007. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also increased to 225% from 157% in 2007. Leverage ratios were impacted by the unrecognized pension plan losses, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 2009 Outlook In 2009, we plan to manage through the impacts of a prolonged economic recession by focusing our efforts on the cyclical impacts in commercial rental and used vehicle sales and concentrating on cost improvement actions. We expect 2009 comparable earnings per diluted common share to decline because of 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) higher pension expense, lower commercial rental and used vehicle sales results and lower volumes, particularly in the automotive industry. We expect to partially offset these negative impacts through cost reduction initiatives, operational improvements and the carryover impact of acquisitions and share repurchases. In 2009, we will continue to focus on our contractual revenue growth and retention strategies, including the evaluation of selective acquisitions, while retaining financial discipline. Total revenue is targeted to decrease by 10% to 16% while operating revenue is expected to decrease by 5% to 11%. The 2009 forecast for total revenue includes the adverse impact of lower anticipated fuel prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Revenue Reporting In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. This contract modification required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation beginning on January 1, 2008. This contract represented $640 million and $565 million of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS We have completed various asset purchase agreements in the past two years, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition.

This strategic acquisition adds complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Earnings before income taxes $ 349,922 405,464 392,973 (14)% 3% Provision for income taxes 150,041 151,603 144,014 (1) 5 Net earnings $ 199,881 253,861 248,959 (21)% 2% Per diluted common share $ 3.52 4.24 4.04 (17)% 5% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 56,790 59,845 61,578 (5)% (3)% Earnings before income taxes (NBT) decreased to $350 million in 2008 compared to $405 million in 2007. NBT in 2008 included a fourth quarter restructuring charge primarily associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe. Comparable NBT increased to $420 million compared to $407 million in the prior year. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased to $200 million in 2008 or $3.52. Net earnings in 2008 included income tax benefits primarily related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions. Comparable net earnings increased to $255 million or $4.49 in 2008 from $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 due to the improvement in NBT. This improvement was slightly offset by a higher tax rate on comparable earnings resulting from an increase in non deductible foreign losses. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2008 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT increased to $405 million in 2007 compared to $393 million in 2006. NBT in 2007 included restructuring charges and a gain on the sale of property. Comparable NBT increased to $407 million compared to $399 million in 2006 reflecting the benefits of (i) lower pension costs; (ii) contractual revenue growth in the FMS business segment; (iii) lower safety and insurance costs; (iv) lower incentive based compensation; and (v) lower depreciation as a result of our annual depreciation review implemented January 1, 2007. These items more than offset the significant impact of weak U.S. commercial rental market demand and lower used vehicle sales results in our FMS business segment. Net earnings increased to $254 million in 2007 compared to $249 million in 2006. Net earnings in 2007 included an income tax benefit primarily associated with enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. Net earnings in 2006 included an income tax benefit associated with enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Comparable net earnings increased to $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 from $246 million or $3.99 in 2006. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2007 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) See subsequent discussion within Full Year Consolidated Results and Full Year Operating Results by Business Segment for additional information on the results noted above. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 4,450,016 4,162,644 4,096,046 7% 2% Supply Chain Solutions 1,643,056 2,250,282 2,028,489 (27) 11 Dedicated Contract Carriage 547,751 567,640 568,842 (4) Eliminations (437,080 ) (414,571 ) (386,734 ) (5) (7) Total $ 6,203,743 6,565,995 6,306,643 (6)% 4% Operating revenue(1) $ 4,704,506 4,636,557 4,454,231 1% 4% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.20 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 1% primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2008 and 2007, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $3,029,673 2,776,999 2,735,752 9% 2% Percentage of revenue 49% 42% 43% Operating expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007 from the impact of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. We continue to realize favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves and as a result benefited from lower safety and insurance costs. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. Operating expense increased in 2007 compared with 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,399,121 1,410,388 1,397,391 (1)% 1% Percentage of revenue 23% 21% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. The number of employees at December 31, 2008 decreased to approximately 28,000 compared to 28,800 at December 31, 2007. We expect headcount to decline in 2009 due to the previously announced strategic initiatives. Pension expense totaled $3 million in 2008 compared to $29 million in 2007. Lower pension expense was primarily a result of the freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. During the third quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the freeze of the defined benefit portion of the Canadian retirement plan, which resulted in a curtailment gain of $4 million. In connection with the freeze of the pension plans, we provided an enhanced 401(k) savings plan to employees. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Total savings plan costs increased $20 million during 2008 primarily as a result of the enhanced 401(k) plan. The net impact of pension and savings plan costs was a net decrease of $6 million for 2008 compared with 2007. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors, such as discount rate and the expected 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) long term rate of return on assets. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the current year effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience. We have experienced significant negative pension asset returns in 2008 the result of which will materially increase pension expense for 2009. We expect 2009 pension expense, on a pre tax basis, to increase approximately $62 million primarily because of a lower than expected return on assets in 2008 partially offset by higher discount rates. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Pension expense decreased $41 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $323,382 950,500 865,475 (66)% 10% Percentage of revenue 5% 14% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Subcontracted transportation expense in 2007 grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $843,459 815,962 743,288 3% 10% Gains on vehicle sales, net (39,312) (44,094) (50,766) (11) (13) Equipment rental 80,105 93,337 90,137 (14) 4 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $843 million in 2008 compared to $816 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. The increases were partially offset by lower adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from increased capital spending and higher adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007.

The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million.

Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.

See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) higher pension expense, lower commercial rental and used vehicle sales results and lower volumes, particularly in the automotive industry. We expect to partially offset these negative impacts through cost reduction initiatives, operational improvements and the carryover impact of acquisitions and share repurchases. In 2009, we will continue to focus on our contractual revenue growth and retention strategies, including the evaluation of selective acquisitions, while retaining financial discipline. Total revenue is targeted to decrease by 10% to 16% while operating revenue is expected to decrease by 5% to 11%. The 2009 forecast for total revenue includes the adverse impact of lower anticipated fuel prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Revenue Reporting In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. This contract modification required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation beginning on January 1, 2008. This contract represented $640 million and $565 million of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS We have completed various asset purchase agreements in the past two years, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network.

NBT in 2008 included a fourth quarter restructuring charge primarily associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe. Comparable NBT increased to $420 million compared to $407 million in the prior year. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased to $200 million in 2008 or $3.52. Net earnings in 2008 included income tax benefits primarily related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions. Comparable net earnings increased to $255 million or $4.49 in 2008 from $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 due to the improvement in NBT. This improvement was slightly offset by a higher tax rate on comparable earnings resulting from an increase in non deductible foreign losses. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2008 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT increased to $405 million in 2007 compared to $393 million in 2006. NBT in 2007 included restructuring charges and a gain on the sale of property. Comparable NBT increased to $407 million compared to $399 million in 2006 reflecting the benefits of (i) lower pension costs; (ii) contractual revenue growth in the FMS business segment; (iii) lower safety and insurance costs; (iv) lower incentive based compensation; and (v) lower depreciation as a result of our annual depreciation review implemented January 1, 2007. These items more than offset the significant impact of weak U.S. commercial rental market demand and lower used vehicle sales results in our FMS business segment. Net earnings increased to $254 million in 2007 compared to $249 million in 2006. Net earnings in 2007 included an income tax benefit primarily associated with enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. Net earnings in 2006 included an income tax benefit associated with enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Comparable net earnings increased to $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 from $246 million or $3.99 in 2006. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2007 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.20 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 1% primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2008 and 2007, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $3,029,673 2,776,999 2,735,752 9% 2% Percentage of revenue 49% 42% 43% Operating expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007 from the impact of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. We continue to realize favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves and as a result benefited from lower safety and insurance costs. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. Operating expense increased in 2007 compared with 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,399,121 1,410,388 1,397,391 (1)% 1% Percentage of revenue 23% 21% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. The number of employees at December 31, 2008 decreased to approximately 28,000 compared to 28,800 at December 31, 2007. We expect headcount to decline in 2009 due to the previously announced strategic initiatives. Pension expense totaled $3 million in 2008 compared to $29 million in 2007. Lower pension expense was primarily a result of the freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. During the third quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the freeze of the defined benefit portion of the Canadian retirement plan, which resulted in a curtailment gain of $4 million. In connection with the freeze of the pension plans, we provided an enhanced 401(k) savings plan to employees. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Total savings plan costs increased $20 million during 2008 primarily as a result of the enhanced 401(k) plan. The net impact of pension and savings plan costs was a net decrease of $6 million for 2008 compared with 2007. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors, such as discount rate and the expected 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) long term rate of return on assets. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the current year effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience. We have experienced significant negative pension asset returns in 2008 the result of which will materially increase pension expense for 2009. We expect 2009 pension expense, on a pre tax basis, to increase approximately $62 million primarily because of a lower than expected return on assets in 2008 partially offset by higher discount rates. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Pension expense decreased $41 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $323,382 950,500 865,475 (66)% 10% Percentage of revenue 5% 14% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Subcontracted transportation expense in 2007 grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $843,459 815,962 743,288 3% 10% Gains on vehicle sales, net (39,312) (44,094) (50,766) (11) (13) Equipment rental 80,105 93,337 90,137 (14) 4 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $843 million in 2008 compared to $816 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. The increases were partially offset by lower adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from increased capital spending and higher adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $157,257 160,074 140,561 (2)% 14% Effective interest rate 5.5% 5.6% 5.7% Interest expense totaled $157 million in 2008 compared to $160 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous expense (income), net $ 1,735 (15,904 ) (11,732 ) (111)% 36% Miscellaneous expense (income), net consists of investment losses (income) on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, losses (gains) from sales of property, foreign currency transaction losses (gains), and non operating items. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates.

The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ Number of Units 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,300 900 4,200 44% (79)% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 6,400 7,500 (2) (15) Other NLE units 1,300 1,000 1,900 30 (47) Total(1) 8,900 8,300 13,600 7% (39)% (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2008, 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, and 1,700 at December 31, 2006, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Earnings before income taxes $ 349,922 405,464 392,973 (14)% 3% Provision for income taxes 150,041 151,603 144,014 (1) 5 Net earnings $ 199,881 253,861 248,959 (21)% 2% Per diluted common share $ 3.52 4.24 4.04 (17)% 5% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 56,790 59,845 61,578 (5)% (3)% Earnings before income taxes (NBT) decreased to $350 million in 2008 compared to $405 million in 2007. NBT in 2008 included a fourth quarter restructuring charge primarily associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe. Comparable NBT increased to $420 million compared to $407 million in the prior year. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased to $200 million in 2008 or $3.52. Net earnings in 2008 included income tax benefits primarily related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions. Comparable net earnings increased to $255 million or $4.49 in 2008 from $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 due to the improvement in NBT. This improvement was slightly offset by a higher tax rate on comparable earnings resulting from an increase in non deductible foreign losses. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2008 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT increased to $405 million in 2007 compared to $393 million in 2006. NBT in 2007 included restructuring charges and a gain on the sale of property. Comparable NBT increased to $407 million compared to $399 million in 2006 reflecting the benefits of (i) lower pension costs; (ii) contractual revenue growth in the FMS business segment; (iii) lower safety and insurance costs; (iv) lower incentive based compensation; and (v) lower depreciation as a result of our annual depreciation review implemented January 1, 2007. These items more than offset the significant impact of weak U.S. commercial rental market demand and lower used vehicle sales results in our FMS business segment. Net earnings increased to $254 million in 2007 compared to $249 million in 2006. Net earnings in 2007 included an income tax benefit primarily associated with enacted changes in Canadian tax laws. Net earnings in 2006 included an income tax benefit associated with enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws. Comparable net earnings increased to $252 million or $4.21 in 2007 from $246 million or $3.99 in 2006. Earnings per diluted common share growth in 2007 exceeded the net earnings growth rate reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.20 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 1% primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2008 and 2007, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $3,029,673 2,776,999 2,735,752 9% 2% Percentage of revenue 49% 42% 43% Operating expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007 from the impact of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. We continue to realize favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves and as a result benefited from lower safety and insurance costs. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. Operating expense increased in 2007 compared with 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,399,121 1,410,388 1,397,391 (1)% 1% Percentage of revenue 23% 21% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. The number of employees at December 31, 2008 decreased to approximately 28,000 compared to 28,800 at December 31, 2007. We expect headcount to decline in 2009 due to the previously announced strategic initiatives. Pension expense totaled $3 million in 2008 compared to $29 million in 2007. Lower pension expense was primarily a result of the freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. During the third quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the freeze of the defined benefit portion of the Canadian retirement plan, which resulted in a curtailment gain of $4 million. In connection with the freeze of the pension plans, we provided an enhanced 401(k) savings plan to employees. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Total savings plan costs increased $20 million during 2008 primarily as a result of the enhanced 401(k) plan. The net impact of pension and savings plan costs was a net decrease of $6 million for 2008 compared with 2007. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors, such as discount rate and the expected 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) long term rate of return on assets. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the current year effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience. We have experienced significant negative pension asset returns in 2008 the result of which will materially increase pension expense for 2009. We expect 2009 pension expense, on a pre tax basis, to increase approximately $62 million primarily because of a lower than expected return on assets in 2008 partially offset by higher discount rates. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Pension expense decreased $41 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $323,382 950,500 865,475 (66)% 10% Percentage of revenue 5% 14% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Subcontracted transportation expense in 2007 grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $843,459 815,962 743,288 3% 10% Gains on vehicle sales, net (39,312) (44,094) (50,766) (11) (13) Equipment rental 80,105 93,337 90,137 (14) 4 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $843 million in 2008 compared to $816 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. The increases were partially offset by lower adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from increased capital spending and higher adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $157,257 160,074 140,561 (2)% 14% Effective interest rate 5.5% 5.6% 5.7% Interest expense totaled $157 million in 2008 compared to $160 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous expense (income), net $ 1,735 (15,904 ) (11,732 ) (111)% 36% Miscellaneous expense (income), net consists of investment losses (income) on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, losses (gains) from sales of property, foreign currency transaction losses (gains), and non operating items. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates.

The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) See subsequent discussion within Full Year Consolidated Results and Full Year Operating Results by Business Segment for additional information on the results noted above. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 4,450,016 4,162,644 4,096,046 7% 2% Supply Chain Solutions 1,643,056 2,250,282 2,028,489 (27) 11 Dedicated Contract Carriage 547,751 567,640 568,842 (4) Eliminations (437,080 ) (414,571 ) (386,734 ) (5) (7) Total $ 6,203,743 6,565,995 6,306,643 (6)% 4% Operating revenue(1) $ 4,704,506 4,636,557 4,454,231 1% 4% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.20 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 1% primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Total revenue increased 4% to $6.57 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by contractual revenue growth in our SCS and FMS business segments, and by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations, offset partially by a decline in FMS commercial rental revenue. SCS revenue growth was due primarily to new and expanded business. Contractual revenue growth in our FMS segment, principally full service lease revenue, resulted from new contract sales and lease replacements beginning in the second half of 2006. We realized revenue growth in all geographic markets served by FMS in 2007. Total revenue in 2007 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increases in eliminations in 2008 and 2007, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $3,029,673 2,776,999 2,735,752 9% 2% Percentage of revenue 49% 42% 43% Operating expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007 from the impact of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. We continue to realize favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves and as a result benefited from lower safety and insurance costs. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. Operating expense increased in 2007 compared with 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,399,121 1,410,388 1,397,391 (1)% 1% Percentage of revenue 23% 21% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. The number of employees at December 31, 2008 decreased to approximately 28,000 compared to 28,800 at December 31, 2007. We expect headcount to decline in 2009 due to the previously announced strategic initiatives. Pension expense totaled $3 million in 2008 compared to $29 million in 2007. Lower pension expense was primarily a result of the freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. During the third quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the freeze of the defined benefit portion of the Canadian retirement plan, which resulted in a curtailment gain of $4 million. In connection with the freeze of the pension plans, we provided an enhanced 401(k) savings plan to employees. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Total savings plan costs increased $20 million during 2008 primarily as a result of the enhanced 401(k) plan. The net impact of pension and savings plan costs was a net decrease of $6 million for 2008 compared with 2007. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors, such as discount rate and the expected 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) long term rate of return on assets. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the current year effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience. We have experienced significant negative pension asset returns in 2008 the result of which will materially increase pension expense for 2009. We expect 2009 pension expense, on a pre tax basis, to increase approximately $62 million primarily because of a lower than expected return on assets in 2008 partially offset by higher discount rates. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Pension expense decreased $41 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in 2007.

Subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Subcontracted transportation expense in 2007 grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $843,459 815,962 743,288 3% 10% Gains on vehicle sales, net (39,312) (44,094) (50,766) (11) (13) Equipment rental 80,105 93,337 90,137 (14) 4 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $843 million in 2008 compared to $816 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. The increases were partially offset by lower adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from increased capital spending and higher adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $157,257 160,074 140,561 (2)% 14% Effective interest rate 5.5% 5.6% 5.7% Interest expense totaled $157 million in 2008 compared to $160 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous expense (income), net $ 1,735 (15,904 ) (11,732 ) (111)% 36% Miscellaneous expense (income), net consists of investment losses (income) on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, losses (gains) from sales of property, foreign currency transaction losses (gains), and non operating items. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates.

The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below.

Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The increases in eliminations in 2008 and 2007, reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $3,029,673 2,776,999 2,735,752 9% 2% Percentage of revenue 49% 42% 43% Operating expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007 from the impact of higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. We continue to realize favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves and as a result benefited from lower safety and insurance costs. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. Operating expense increased in 2007 compared with 2006 in conjunction with the growth in operating revenue as well as higher fuel costs due to higher average market prices. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower safety and insurance costs due to favorable development in prior years self insurance loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,399,121 1,410,388 1,397,391 (1)% 1% Percentage of revenue 23% 21% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 31% Salaries and employee related costs decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. The number of employees at December 31, 2008 decreased to approximately 28,000 compared to 28,800 at December 31, 2007. We expect headcount to decline in 2009 due to the previously announced strategic initiatives. Pension expense totaled $3 million in 2008 compared to $29 million in 2007. Lower pension expense was primarily a result of the freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans. On January 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. During the third quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the freeze of the defined benefit portion of the Canadian retirement plan, which resulted in a curtailment gain of $4 million. In connection with the freeze of the pension plans, we provided an enhanced 401(k) savings plan to employees. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. Total savings plan costs increased $20 million during 2008 primarily as a result of the enhanced 401(k) plan. The net impact of pension and savings plan costs was a net decrease of $6 million for 2008 compared with 2007. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors, such as discount rate and the expected 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) long term rate of return on assets. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the current year effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience. We have experienced significant negative pension asset returns in 2008 the result of which will materially increase pension expense for 2009. We expect 2009 pension expense, on a pre tax basis, to increase approximately $62 million primarily because of a lower than expected return on assets in 2008 partially offset by higher discount rates. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Pension expense decreased $41 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $323,382 950,500 865,475 (66)% 10% Percentage of revenue 5% 14% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Subcontracted transportation expense in 2007 grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $843,459 815,962 743,288 3% 10% Gains on vehicle sales, net (39,312) (44,094) (50,766) (11) (13) Equipment rental 80,105 93,337 90,137 (14) 4 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $843 million in 2008 compared to $816 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. The increases were partially offset by lower adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from increased capital spending and higher adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $157,257 160,074 140,561 (2)% 14% Effective interest rate 5.5% 5.6% 5.7% Interest expense totaled $157 million in 2008 compared to $160 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous expense (income), net $ 1,735 (15,904 ) (11,732 ) (111)% 36% Miscellaneous expense (income), net consists of investment losses (income) on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, losses (gains) from sales of property, foreign currency transaction losses (gains), and non operating items. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.

See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) long term rate of return on assets. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the current year effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience. We have experienced significant negative pension asset returns in 2008 the result of which will materially increase pension expense for 2009. We expect 2009 pension expense, on a pre tax basis, to increase approximately $62 million primarily because of a lower than expected return on assets in 2008 partially offset by higher discount rates. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of merit increases and higher outside labor costs from new and expanded business in our SCS business segment offset partially by lower pension expense and incentive based compensation. Average headcount increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006. Pension expense decreased $41 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due to (i) higher expected return on assets because of prior year actual returns and contributions, and (ii) the impact of higher interest rate levels at December 31, 2006. Incentive based compensation expense decreased $15 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as we achieved a lower level of performance relative to target in 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $323,382 950,500 865,475 (66)% 10% Percentage of revenue 5% 14% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Subcontracted transportation expense in 2007 grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs, resulting from increased fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. The impact to net earnings is the same whether we are acting as an agent or principal in the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $843,459 815,962 743,288 3% 10% Gains on vehicle sales, net (39,312) (44,094) (50,766) (11) (13) Equipment rental 80,105 93,337 90,137 (14) 4 Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased to $843 million in 2008 compared to $816 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. The increases were partially offset by lower adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation expense increased to $816 million in 2007 compared to $743 million in 2006, reflecting higher average vehicle investment from increased capital spending and higher adjustments in the carrying value of vehicles held for 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $157,257 160,074 140,561 (2)% 14% Effective interest rate 5.5% 5.6% 5.7% Interest expense totaled $157 million in 2008 compared to $160 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous expense (income), net $ 1,735 (15,904 ) (11,732 ) (111)% 36% Miscellaneous expense (income), net consists of investment losses (income) on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, losses (gains) from sales of property, foreign currency transaction losses (gains), and non operating items. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $150,041 151,603 144,014 (1)% 5% Effective tax rate 42.9% 37.4% 36.6% The 2008 effective income tax rate increased due to the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges and higher non deductible foreign losses in the current year, mostly in our Brazil, Argentina and Chile operations. The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,701 16,282 16,983 Dedicated Contract Carriage 15,102 14,966 16,749 Total $ 31,803 31,248 33,732 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 27, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) sale of $18 million. 2007 benefited from adjustments made to residual values as part of our annual depreciation review. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2007 review, the adjustment to 2008 depreciation was not significant. Based on the results of our 2006 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2007. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2007 by approximately $11 million compared with 2006. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to 2009 depreciation is not significant. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. In 2007, we had excess used truck inventories and increased our wholesale activity in order to reduce inventory levels. Wholesale prices are lower than our retail prices and result in lower gains per unit. In light of current market conditions, we expect a significant decline in overall used vehicle sales results, including gains and carrying value adjustments, reflecting lower retail prices and higher wholesale activity. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a decline in the average price of vehicles sold mostly as a result of wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased $13 million in 2008 due to the reduction in the average number of leased vehicles. Equipment rental increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the sale and leaseback of $150 million of revenue earning equipment completed in May 2007. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $157,257 160,074 140,561 (2)% 14% Effective interest rate 5.5% 5.6% 5.7% Interest expense totaled $157 million in 2008 compared to $160 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense reflects a lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. The growth in interest expense in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects higher average debt levels to support capital spending, the funding of global pension contributions in 2006 and share repurchase programs. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Miscellaneous expense (income), net $ 1,735 (15,904 ) (11,732 ) (111)% 36% Miscellaneous expense (income), net consists of investment losses (income) on securities used to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, losses (gains) from sales of property, foreign currency transaction losses (gains), and non operating items. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $150,041 151,603 144,014 (1)% 5% Effective tax rate 42.9% 37.4% 36.6% The 2008 effective income tax rate increased due to the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges and higher non deductible foreign losses in the current year, mostly in our Brazil, Argentina and Chile operations. The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ Number of Units 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,300 900 4,200 44% (79)% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 6,400 7,500 (2) (15) Other NLE units 1,300 1,000 1,900 30 (47) Total(1) 8,900 8,300 13,600 7% (39)% (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2008, 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, and 1,700 at December 31, 2006, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 25, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in the current year was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the declining market performance of our investments classified as trading securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains this year compared to losses in the prior year. Miscellaneous expense (income), net increased to $16 million in 2007 compared to $12 million in 2006 because of the $10 million gain recognized on the sale of property. Miscellaneous expense (income), net also increased by $2 million as a result of a favorable contractual litigation settlement in 2007 compared with an unfavorable settlement in 2006. These favorable items were offset by (i) $3 million of additional foreign currency transaction losses compared with 2006, (ii) a 2006 business interruption insurance claim recovery from hurricane related losses of $3 million ($2 million within our FMS business segment and $1 million within our DCC business segment), and (iii) a one time recovery of $2 million in 2006 for the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 58,401 13,269 3,564 2008 Activity During the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced several restructuring initiatives designed to address current global economic conditions and drive long term profitable growth. The initiatives include discontinuing supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile during 2009 and transitioning out of SCS customer contracts in Europe. These actions will enable us to focus the organization and resources to expand our service offerings, further diversify our mix of industries served and continue our pursuit of tuck in and strategic acquisitions that create synergies and or expand capabilities. Our actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million, including severance and other termination benefits, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Approximately, 2,500 employees support the discontinued operations. The majority of the separation actions are expected to be completed and will start to benefit earnings by the latter part of 2009. In connection with the decision to transition out of European supply chain contracts and a declining economic environment, we performed an impairment analysis relating to our U.K. FMS reporting unit. Based on our analysis, given current market conditions and business expectations, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of $10 million related to the write off of goodwill. In addition to the longer term strategic initiatives described above, we approved a plan to eliminate approximately 700 positions, primarily in the U.S. across all business segments. The workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of which related to the payment of severance and other termination benefits. These actions will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The workforce reduction is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $38 million once all activities are completed. 2007 Activity Restructuring and other charges, net in 2007 related primarily to $10 million of employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives and $2 million of contract termination costs. We approved a plan to eliminate approximately 300 positions as a result of cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international operations and Central Support Services (CSS). By December 31, 2008, the 2007 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs throughout most of 2008. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates.

The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and other charges, net also included a charge of $1 million incurred to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2017. The charge included the premium paid on the early extinguishment of debt and the write off of related debt discount and issuance costs. 2006 Activity During 2006, we recorded net restructuring and other charges of $4 million that primarily consisted of early debt retirement costs and employee severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with global cost savings initiatives. The majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to prior year severance and employee related accruals and contract termination costs. By December 31, 2007, the 2006 actions were completed and the cost reductions associated with these activities benefited salaries and employee related costs in the latter half of 2007. As part of ongoing cost management actions, we incurred $2 million of costs in the fourth quarter to extinguish debentures that were originally set to mature in 2016. The total debt retirement costs consisted of the premium paid on the early extinguishment and the write off of the related debt discount and issuance costs. We realized annual pre tax interest savings of approximately $2 million from the early extinguishment of these debentures. In 2006, we also approved a plan to eliminate approximately 150 positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions throughout our domestic and international business segments and CSS. The charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling $1 million. During 2006, we also had employee related accruals and contract termination costs recorded in prior restructuring charges that were adjusted due to subsequent refinements in estimates. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $150,041 151,603 144,014 (1)% 5% Effective tax rate 42.9% 37.4% 36.6% The 2008 effective income tax rate increased due to the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges and higher non deductible foreign losses in the current year, mostly in our Brazil, Argentina and Chile operations. The income tax rate in 2008 benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. The 2006 effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of $7 million from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in Texas and Canadian tax laws.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,701 16,282 16,983 Dedicated Contract Carriage 15,102 14,966 16,749 Total $ 31,803 31,248 33,732 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 27, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. Fleet Management Solutions Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Full service lease $ 2,042,064 1,965,308 1,848,141 4% 6% Contract maintenance 168,157 159,635 141,933 5 12 Contractual revenue 2,210,221 2,124,943 1,990,074 4 7 Contract related maintenance 193,856 198,747 193,134 (2) 3 Commercial rental 557,532 583,336 665,730 (4) (12) Other 73,079 72,390 72,124 1 Operating revenue(1) 3,034,688 2,979,416 2,921,062 2 2 Fuel services revenue 1,415,328 1,183,228 1,174,984 20 1 Total revenue $ 4,450,016 4,162,644 4,096,046 7% 2% Segment NBT $ 398,540 373,697 368,069 7% 2% Segment NBT as a % of total revenue 9.0% 9.0% 9.0% bps bps Segment NBT as a % of operating revenue(1) 13.1% 12.5% 12.6% 60 bps (10) bps (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our FMS business segment and as a measure of sales activity. Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below.

Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 16,701 16,282 16,983 Dedicated Contract Carriage 15,102 14,966 16,749 Total $ 31,803 31,248 33,732 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion compared to $4.16 billion in 2007 due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased in 2008 due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.03 billion compared to $2.98 billion in 2007 as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset the decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. We expect contractual revenue levels to remain flat with the current year as real growth will be offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline. The following table provides rental statistics for the U.S. fleet, which generates more than 80% of total commercial rental revenue: Years ended December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,704 259,723 282,528 2% (8)% Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 182,735 210,657 277,461 (13)% (24)% Average commercial rental fleet size in service(2) 27,600 29,600 32,800 (7)% (10)% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 20,300 21,100 24,100 (4)% (12)% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 71.7% 71.0% 71.9% 70 bps (90) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) with 2007. We expect commercial rental revenue comparisons in 2009 to decline from 2008 levels because of continuing weak market demand and pricing decline.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used truck inventories. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $4.16 billion compared to $4.10 billion in 2006 and operating revenue increased 2% in 2007 to $2.98 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2006, due to contractual revenue growth offset by decreased commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2007 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2007. Full service lease revenue grew 6% due to higher new contract sales and lease replacements in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 12% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 12% in 2007 due to weak U.S. market demand. We reduced our rental fleet size throughout the year in response to weak demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. FMS NBT increased $6 million in 2007 due primarily to improved contractual business performance and lower pension expense of $32 million. This improvement was partially offset by a substantial decline in commercial rental results due to a lower rental fleet and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing as well as lower used vehicle sales results. Used vehicles sales results declined $25 million in 2007 due to higher valuation adjustments on an increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale in North America and lower gains from the sale of used vehicles due to wholesale activity taken to reduce excess used truck inventories. Depreciation expense, although higher than 2006, benefited $11 million from our annual depreciation review effective January 1, 2007. FMS NBT in 2007 also benefited from lower safety and insurance costs and lower incentive based compensation. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the U.S. fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Change 2008/ 2007/ Number of Units 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 1,300 900 4,200 44% (79)% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 6,400 7,500 (2) (15) Other NLE units 1,300 1,000 1,900 30 (47) Total(1) 8,900 8,300 13,600 7% (39)% (1) Non revenue earning equipment for FMS operations outside the U.S. totaled approximately 1,500 vehicles at December 31, 2008, 1,900 vehicles at December 31, 2007, and 1,700 at December 31, 2006, which are not included above. NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2008, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year consistent with higher lease replacement activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect the number of NLE units in 2009 to be up modestly from 2008 levels.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 27% to $1.64 billion in 2008 compared to $2.25 billion in 2007 as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 1% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, SCS operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 0.2%. Our largest customer, General Motors Corporation (GM), accounted for approximately 17% of both SCS total and operating revenue in 2008, and is comprised of multiple contracts in various geographic regions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we announced that we were transitioning out of our current operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile and supply chain contracts in Europe. These operations accounted for approximately $209 million, $209 million and $174 million of total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and approximately $119 million, $127 million and $106 million of operating revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately 45% of operating revenue was in the automotive sector for the year ended December 31, 2008. These operations will be reported as part of continuing operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements until all operations cease. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term because of current market conditions, particularly related to automotive production volumes, the impact of discontinued operations in South America and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. SCS NBT decreased $20 million in 2008 largely driven by lower operating results related to South America and the start up of a U.S. based operation. South Americas results declined $15 million, primarily in Brazil, due to higher transportation and labor costs and adverse developments in certain litigation related matters. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue grew 11% to $2.25 billion in 2007 compared to $2.03 billion in 2006 as a result of new and expanded business, increased levels of managed subcontracted transportation and favorable foreign currency exchange rates slightly offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure. SCS operating revenue grew 11% in 2007. For 2007, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. In 2007, GM accounted for approximately 42% and 19% of SCS total revenue and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT increased slightly in 2007 as a result of new and expanded business, particularly in international markets served, lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and lower safety and insurance costs. The decrease in safety and insurance costs was mainly due to favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. The increase in NBT was partially offset by the impact of a significant automotive plant closure and a $3 million net benefit recognized in the prior year related to a contract termination. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% to $537 million in 2008 as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons in the near term primarily driven by lower volumes associated with the current economic environment and lower fuel cost pass throughs. DCC NBT increased $2 million to $50 million in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2007 versus 2006 Total revenue of $568 million was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 because of decreased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased slightly in 2007 due to pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of better operating performance and lower safety and insurance costs offset slightly by lower FMS equipment contribution. The decrease in safety and insurance costs reflects favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

CSS costs in 2007 were impacted by (i) higher severance and foreign currency transaction losses; (ii) a non cash compensation charge of $2 million related to an adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock units; and (iii) the one time recovery in 2006 of $2 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies. These cost increases were offset by lower incentive based compensation of $7 million and a prior year litigation settlement charge associated with a discontinued operation. Unallocated CSS expense increased in 2007 because of higher foreign currency transaction losses, the adjustment in the amortization of restricted stock unit compensation expense and higher severance expense offset partially by lower incentive based compensation of $3 million and the litigation settlement charge in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below.

Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008/ 2007 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,373,798 1,666,200 (18)% Operating revenue $ 1,109,469 1,189,599 (7)% Earnings before income taxes $ 33,178 111,797 (70) Provision for income taxes 22,533 39,851 (43) Net earnings $ 10,645 71,946 (85)% Per diluted common share $ 0.19 1.24 (85)% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,499 58,099 (4)% Total revenue decreased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue in 2008 was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant SCS customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or net earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded revenue of $133 million related to this contractual relationship. Excluding this item, total revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of lower fuel services revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements related to international operations. Operating revenue decreased 7% primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, lower commercial rental revenue, lower automotive volumes and lower fuel services revenue in DCC which more than offset contractual revenue growth. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.6%. NBT decreased to $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $112 million in the same period in 2007. 2008 NBT included a fourth quarter restructuring and other charges of $58 million ($53 million after tax or $0.96 per diluted common share) associated with a plan to discontinue current supply chain operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Europe and workforce reductions, primarily in the U.S. See Note 4, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. The decline in NBT was also due to deteriorating economic conditions which impacted commercial rental demand in FMS and volumes in SCS and DCC. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included income tax benefits of $8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a benefit of $4 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Declines in commercial rental revenue of 15% more than offset contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3%. FMS NBT decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a decline in global commercial rental results partially offset by improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak market demand which drove lower utilization and reduced pricing. FMS NBT included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 35% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Total revenue declined largely due to a previously announced change in reporting of a transportation services arrangement from a gross to a net basis. Excluding this contract change, total revenue declined 13%. Operating revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower automotive volumes and 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 8% and 7%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to lower international operating results and, to a lesser extent, the impact of lower automotive revenue partially offset by lower compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period. Operating revenue decreased 12% compared with the year earlier period. Revenue decreased due to the impact of the non renewal of customer contracts, lower volumes as well as the pass through of lower fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with the year earlier period due to better operating margins and improved efficiencies. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs were $9 million compared to $14 million in 2007. The improvement in CSS costs primarily reflects lower compensation and prior year severance expense. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Financing activities (150,630 ) (299,203 ) 488,202 Investing activities (1,102,790 ) (823,219 ) (1,339,550 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,735 7,303 (2,327 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,846 (12,180 ) (88 ) A detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.26 billion in 2008 compared to $1.10 billion in 2007, because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities was $151 million in 2008 compared with cash used of $299 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflects higher borrowing needs partially offset by higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2008 compared to $823 million in 2007 primarily due to acquisition related payments in 2008 and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.10 billion in 2007 compared to $854 million in 2006, because of higher cash based earnings, reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections, lower income tax payments of $87 million and lower pension contributions of $70 million. Cash used in financing activities was $299 million in 2007 compared with cash provided of $488 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 reflects lower borrowing needs and higher share repurchase activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $823 million in 2007 compared to 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) $1.34 billion in 2006 as a result of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, a $150 million sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition related payments. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,255,531 1,102,939 853,587 Sales of revenue earning equipment 260,598 354,767 326,079 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,302 18,868 6,575 Collections on direct finance leases 61,944 63,358 66,274 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 395 1,588 2,163 Total cash generated 1,582,770 1,691,868 1,254,678 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,234,065 ) (1,317,236 ) (1,695,064 ) Free cash flow $ 348,705 374,632 (440,386 ) Free cash flow decreased to $349 million in 2008 compared to $375 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. Free cash flow improved to $375 million in 2007 compared to negative $440 million in 2006 because of lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending, reduced working capital needs, the sale leaseback transaction completed in 2007 and lower pension contributions during 2007. We expect free cash flow in 2009 to increase to $365 million based on lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher pension contributions, cash taxes and working capital needs. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 986,333 900,028 1,492,720 Commercial rental 171,128 218,830 195,023 1,157,461 1,118,858 1,687,743 Operating property and equipment 111,539 75,978 71,772 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,269,000 1,194,836 1,759,515 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (34,935 ) 122,400 (64,451 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,234,065 1,317,236 1,695,064 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. Capital expenditures decreased in 2007 as a result of lower full service lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $940 million in 2009 largely as a result of the elimination of virtually all planned commercial rental spending. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. During 2008, we completed four acquisitions related to the FMS and SCS segment. Total consideration paid in 2008 for these acquisitions was $246 million. In 2007, we completed the acquisition of Pollock NationaLease in Canada. Total consideration paid during 2007 for this acquisition was $75 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. On February 2, 2009, we acquired the assets of Edart Leasing Company LLC (Edart) which included Edarts fleet of approximately 1,600 vehicles and more than 340 contractual customers complementing our FMS market coverage and service network in the Northeast United States. We also acquired approximately 525 vehicles that will be re marketed. We will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in 2009. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was negative $160 million in 2008 compared to $203 million in 2007. The decline in net working capital was due to a higher amount of short term debt outstanding under the trade receivables program and increased current maturities of long term debt. The decline was also due to a decrease in receivables from improved collections and lower fuel services revenue. We expect to fund these debt requirements with issuances of commercial paper. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (page 51) of PART II of this report. 60 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below. Our debt ratings are as follows: Short term Long term Outlook(1) Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (June 2004)(2) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (July 2005) (1) Month and year attained. (2) In February 2009, Moodys Investors Service affirmed their long term debt rating and outlook. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have access to the commercial paper markets. There is no guarantee that such markets will continue to be available to us at terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing on contractually committed lending agreements as described below and (or) by seeking other funding sources. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our revolving credit facility and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. We can borrow up to $870 million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lenders. The credit facility matures in May 2010 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 11 basis points, which applies to the total facility of $870 million, and is based on Ryders current credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement, of less than or equal to 300%. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 181%. At December 31, 2008, $825 million was available under the credit facility. Foreign borrowings of $8 million were outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In September 2008, we renewed our trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to Ryder Receivable Funding II, L.L.C. (RRF LLC), a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in our unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates. The available proceeds that may be received under the program are limited to $250 million. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on September 8, 2009. The program 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the securitized receivables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $190 million and $100 million, respectively, was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to new capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 15, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. At December 31, 2008, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 825 Trade receivables program 60 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2008 2007 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,776,129 2,816,943 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings (522,312 ) (159,771 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 250,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 207,077 263,021 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (90,000 ) (263,021 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (48,209 ) (175,979 ) 96,556 (85,750 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 18,391 (96 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 1,430 10,920 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (29,707 ) 34,112 Total changes in debt 86,670 (40,814 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at December 31, 2008 and 31% at December 31, 2007. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2008 of Equity 2007 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,862,799 213% $ 2,776,129 147% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 163,039 177,992 Total obligations $ 3,025,838 225% $ 2,954,121 157% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2008 is driven by the decline in equity caused by unrecognized losses on our pension plans, share repurchases, foreign currency translation adjustments and acquisitions. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party not deemed to be a VIE and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during 2008 and 2006. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and (or) timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million and $16 million, respectively, and we accrued $1 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007, as a corresponding liability. See Note 18, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 381,752 827,700 620,157 1,021,349 2,850,958 Capital lease obligations 2,510 3,071 2,827 3,433 11,841 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 384,262 830,771 622,984 1,024,782 2,862,799 Interest on debt(2) 147,535 239,874 164,517 238,678 790,604 Operating leases(3) 112,734 187,248 72,101 68,090 440,173 Purchase obligations(4) 293,918 7,643 2,415 10 303,986 Total contractual cash obligations 554,187 434,765 239,033 306,778 1,534,763 Insurance obligations(5) 109,167 92,722 38,034 33,616 273,539 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 36,953 4,223 1,260 45,686 88,122 Total $ 1,084,569 1,362,481 901,311 1,410,862 4,759,223 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2008. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2009, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $100 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2009 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the present value of required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $571 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $56 million of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 13, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits under the defined benefit plan after January 1, 2010 and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under the defined contribution portion of the plan. All retirement benefits earned as of January 1, 2010 will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2009 will not be eligible to participate in the Canadian defined benefit plan. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a curtailment gain of $4 million (pre tax). In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees ceased accruing further benefits after December 31, 2007 and began participating in an enhanced 401(k) plan. Those participants that met the grandfathering criteria were given the option to either continue to earn benefits in the U.S. pension plans or transition into an enhanced 401(k) plan. All retirement benefits earned as of December 31, 2007 were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. Employees hired after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. We had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $480 million and $148 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2008 reflects the decline in our funded status as a result of significant negative asset returns during 2008. Total asset returns for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) were negative 31% in 2008. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2008, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $21 million compared to $60 million in 2007. We estimate 2009 pension contributions, including our international plans, will be $100 million of which approximately $73 million represents voluntary contributions for the U.S. pension plan. After considering the 2008 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $571 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 19, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,615,000 shares under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $170 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired 1,363,436 shares under the anti dilutive repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $86 million. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions is determined based on managements evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we temporarily paused purchases under both programs given current market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial conditions and will resume repurchases when we believe it is prudent to do so. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $52 million in 2008, $50 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006. During 2008, we increased our annual dividend to $0.92 per share of common stock. In February 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (page 51) of PART II of this report. 60 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $2.18 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and a fair value of $1.88 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2008 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $11 million. At December 31, 2008, we had $673 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 5.25%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2008 was recorded as an asset totaling $18 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would impact 2008 pre tax earnings by approximately $3 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately $6 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million and negative $0.1 million, respectively, used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. The potential loss in fair value of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2008. We estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Forward looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts. These statements are often preceded by or include the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, will, may, could, should or similar expressions. This Annual Report contains forward looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding: the status of our unrecognized tax benefits for 2008 related to the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax positions and the impact of recent state tax law changes; our expectations as to anticipated revenue and earnings trends and future economic conditions specifically, earnings per share, operating revenue, used vehicle sales results, contract revenue growth and commercial rental declines; the economic and business impact of continuing supply chain operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K. and Asia markets and workforce reductions; the anticipated pre tax annual cost savings from our global cost savings initiatives; our ability to successfully achieve the operational goals that are the basis of our business strategies, including offering competitive pricing, diversifying our customer base, optimizing asset utilization, leveraging the expertise of our various business segments, serving our customers global needs and expanding our support services; impact of losses from conditional obligations arising from guarantees; our expectations as to the future level of vehicle wholesaling activity; number of NLE vehicles in inventory, and the size of our commercial rental fleet, for the remainder of the year; estimates of free cash flow and, capital expenditures for 2009; the adequacy of our accounting estimates and reserves for pension expense, depreciation and residual value guarantees, self insurance reserves, goodwill impairment, accounting changes and income taxes; our ability to fund all of our operations for the foreseeable future through internally generated funds and outside funding sources; the anticipated impact of fuel price fluctuations; our expectations as to future pension expense and contributions, the impact of pension legislation, as well as the effect of the freeze of the U.S. and Canadian pension plan on our benefit funding requirements; the anticipated deferral of tax gains on disposal of eligible revenue earning equipment pursuant to our vehicle like kind exchange program; our expectations as to the future effect of amendments to our contractual relationship with GM; and our expectations regarding the effect of the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements. These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The risks included in the Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2008, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of 2008, we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. In connection with this review, we reduced the residual values of certain vehicle classes and increased the useful lives of certain vehicle classes. Based on the results of our analysis, the adjustment to the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on January 1, 2009 was not significant. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2009 by approximately $94 million. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. See Note 2, Accounting Changes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2008, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $2 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. While we believe that the amounts are adequate, changes to managements estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles, the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2009 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2008, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 8.4% from 8.5% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed based upon actual experience. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. For purposes of estimating mortality in the measurement of our pension obligation, as of December 31, 2007, we began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected seven years. The rates in the table were adjusted to reflect our historical experience over the past 5 years and to reflect future mortality improvements. Previously, we used the 1994 Uninsured Pensioners Mortality Tables (UP 94). The impact of this change to our benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was not material. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $754 million at the end of 2008 compared to a loss of $238 million at the end of 2007. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2008 resulted primarily from lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. Prior to 2008, our amortization period was historically based on the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits (8 years). However, due to the freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan, almost all of the plans participants became inactive beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2009 and future years will be $606 million. The effect on years beyond 2009 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2008 net pension expense is presented in Note 23, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2009 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2009 Net December 31, 2008 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate increase 6.35% + 0.25% $0.5 million $35 million Discount rate decrease 6.35% 0.25% + $0.3 million + $35 million Expected long term rate of return on assets 8.40% +/ 0.25% /+ $2.0 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $256 million and $278 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. While we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a benefit of $23 million, $24 million, and $12 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2008, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2009 by approximately $12 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flow are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test, performed as of April 1, 2008, did not result in any impairment of goodwill. Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter and our decision to exit certain contracts in SCS Europe, we updated our annual impairment test as of December 31, 2008. Based on our analysis, current market conditions and business expectations relating to our European FMS and SCS business units, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million for all goodwill in the U.K. as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $198 million. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007 and 2006, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million and $565 million, respectively. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $399 million and $207 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $28 million and $15 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a% of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.
