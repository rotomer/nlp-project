ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. The following MDA describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations, and critical accounting estimates. OVERVIEW Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our business is divided into three business segments, which operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology, and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our$ customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, electronics, transportation, grocery, lumber and wood products, food service, and home furnishing. The Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing, contract maintenance, contract related maintenance, and commercial rental of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. FMS revenue and assets in 2009 were $3.28 billion and $5.76 billion, respectively, representing 67% of our consolidated revenue and 92% of consolidated assets. The Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting including distribution and transportation services throughout North America and Asia. SCS revenue in 2009 was $1.14 billion, representing 23% of our consolidated revenue. The Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S. DCC revenue in 2009 was $471 million, representing 10% of our consolidated revenue. In 2009, we managed through the impacts of a prolonged economic recession and the cyclical impacts in commercial rental, used vehicle sales, and SCS automotive volumes and concentrated on cost improvement actions. In the second half of 2009, we successfully implemented our plan to disengage SCS operations in South America and Europe. Throughout 2009, we experienced significant volume declines across all business segments resulting from the weak overall economic environment and protracted freight recession. However, our free cash flow and liquidity position remained strong. Total revenue was $4.89 billion, down 19% from $6.00 billion in 2008. Operating revenue (total revenue less fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $4.06 billion in 2009, down 11%. Operating revenue declined primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and reduced SCS automotive industry volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Earnings from continuing operations decreased to $90 million in 2009 from $258 million in 2008 and earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share decreased to $1.62 from $4.51 in 2008. Earnings from continuing operations included certain items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations and have been excluded from our comparable earnings measure. The following discussion provides 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) a summary of the 2009 and 2008 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MDA and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Continuing Operations Earnings Before Diluted Earnings Income Taxes Earnings per Share (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2009 Earnings / EPS from Continuing Operations $ 143,769 $ 90,117 $ 1.62 Restructuring and other charges 6,406 4,176 0.08 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (2,239 ) (0.04 ) Benefit from a tax law change in Ontario, Canada (4,100 ) (0.07 ) Charges related to impairment of international asset(1) 6,676 6,676 0.12 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 156,851 $ 94,630 $ 1.70 2008 Earnings / EPS from Continuing Operations $ 409,288 $ 257,579 $ 4.51 Restructuring and other charges 21,480 17,493 0.31 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (7,931 ) (0.14 ) Benefit from a tax law change primarily in Massachusetts (1,614 ) (0.03 ) Charges related to impairment of international asset(1) 1,617 1,617 0.03 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 432,385 $ 267,144 $ 4.68 (1) Refer to Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations were down 65% to $95 million in 2009. Comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations were down 64% to $1.70 in 2009. Results reflect significantly lower earnings in FMS, driven by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental and full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by higher pension expense. Earnings were favorably impacted by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Free cash flow was up 80% to $614 million in 2009. This increase reflects lower capital expenditures partially offset by lower earnings and higher pension contributions. With our strong cash flows, we repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares of common stock in 2009 for $116 million and made voluntary pension contributions of approximately $100 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 9% to $1.00 per share of common stock. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009. The decrease in capital expenditures reflects reduced full service lease vehicles spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current environment, and planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Our debt balances decreased 13% to $2.50 billion at December 31, 2009 due to the utilization of free cash flow to repay debt. Our debt to equity ratio also decreased to 175% from 213% in 2008. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also decreased to 183% from 225% in 2008. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 Outlook In 2010, we plan to manage through the cumulative impacts of a prolonged recession on full service lease, while driving benefits from actions taken in 2009 as well as new initiatives. Earnings per share growth is expected from improved commercial rental performance, productivity initiatives, better used vehicle sales operations, stronger SCS results, lower annual pension expense and the benefit of 2009 stock repurchases. These items are partially offset by significantly reduced full service lease results, the negative impact of vehicle residual value changes and some currently intended compensation restoration. Total revenue for the full year 2010 is forecast to be $4.90 billion, which is flat compared with 2009. Operating revenue for the full year 2010 is forecast to be down 2% to $4.00 billion compared with 2009. In FMS, core contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to decline 4%, or down 5% excluding foreign exchange, reflecting the cumulative effect of customer fleet downsizing. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 9%, driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. Total SCS revenue is forecast to decrease by 2%. SCS operating revenue is anticipated to decrease by 3%, or 6% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and fuel, reflecting the impact of non renewed contracts. Total DCC revenue is expected to be unchanged. DCC operating revenue is expected to decrease by 1%, or 2% excluding the impact of fuel due to lower freight volumes. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Revenue Reporting In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. This contract modification required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation beginning on January 1, 2008. This contract represented $640 million of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS We completed five FMS acquisitions in the past three years, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complemented our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) On December 19, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. (CRSA) in Canada, as well as CRSA operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. This strategic acquisition added complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Change Years ended December 31 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 143,769 409,288 402,204 (65 )% 2 % Provision for income taxes 53,652 151,709 150,425 (65 ) 1 Earnings from continuing operations 90,117 257,579 251,779 (65 ) 2 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (28,172 ) (57,698 ) 2,082 NM NM Net earnings $ 61,945 199,881 253,861 (69 )% (21 )% Earnings (loss) per common share Diluted Continuing operations $ 1.62 4.51 4.19 (64 )% 8 % Discontinued operations (0.51 ) (1.01 ) 0.03 NM NM Net earnings $ 1.11 3.50 4.22 (68 )% (17 )% Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 55,094 56,539 59,728 (3 )% (5 )% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) decreased 65% in 2009 to $144 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million. NBT increased 2% in 2008 to $409 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 8% in 2008 to $432 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 8% to $267 million. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased 21% in 2008 to $200 million or $3.50 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2008 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $58 million. See subsequent discussion within Full Year Consolidated Results and Full Year Operating Results by Business Segment and refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for other items impacting comparability related to discontinued operations, restructuring and other charges and income taxes. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 3,567,836 4,454,251 4,167,301 (20 )% 7 % Supply Chain Solutions 1,139,911 1,429,632 2,038,186 (20 ) (30 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 470,956 547,751 567,640 (14 ) (4 ) Eliminations (291,449 ) (432,593 ) (409,997 ) 33 (6 ) Total $ 4,887,254 5,999,041 6,363,130 (19 )% (6 )% Operating revenue(1) $ 4,062,512 4,590,080 4,515,080 (11 )% 2 % (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.00 billion in 2008 and was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.59 billion in 2008 primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. The increase in eliminations in 2008 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,229,539 2,959,518 2,739,952 (25)% 8% Percentage of revenue 46% 49% 43% 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. The reduction in fuel costs was driven by a decline in average U.S. fuel prices as well as lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in 2009 was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense increased 8% to $2.96 billion in 2008 as a result of higher fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs was due to higher average market prices. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,233,243 1,345,216 1,348,212 (8)% % Percentage of revenue 25% 22% 21% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 29% 30% Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, decreased 9% in 2009. The number of employees at December 31, 2009 decreased to approximately 22,900 compared to 25,500 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2008. The lower headcount was driven by reduced volumes in our SCS and DCC business segments and workforce reductions made as part of restructuring initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Pension expense totaled $66 million in 2009 compared to $2 million in 2008. Increased pension expense was primarily a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. Our Board of Directors has approved amendments to freeze U.K. and Canadian pension plans effective in 2010. The Canadian pension plan was frozen for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after the freeze and begin participating in defined contribution plans. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect 2010 pension expense to decrease approximately $23 million primarily because of higher than expected return on assets in 2009, the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the freeze of the U.K. and Canadian pension plans. However, we expect this pension decrease to be partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expense. Our 2010 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased slightly to $1.35 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. Pension expense decreased by $25 million as the result of a freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans; however, this benefit was partially offset by an increase of $20 million in defined contribution plan expense. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $198,860 233,106 868,437 (15)% (73)% Percentage of revenue 4% 4% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes in the current economic environment. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 73% to $233 million in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $881,216 836,149 810,544 5 % 3 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (12,292) (39,020) (44,090) (68 ) (11 ) Equipment rental 65,828 78,292 86,415 (16 ) (9 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $24 million, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010, the impact of recent acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. Depreciation expense increased 3% to $836 million in 2008 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2009, based on current and expected market conditions, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $10 million in 2009. At the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 and 2007 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $144,342 152,448 155,970 (5)% (2)% Effective interest rate 5.4% 5.3% 5.5% Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. Interest expense decreased 2% to $152 million in 2008 because of lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.6 million. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $ (3,657 ) 2,564 (15,309 ) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the decline in market performance of our investment securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains compared to losses in 2007. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 10,795 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $53,652 151,709 150,425 (65)% 1% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 37.3% 37.1% 37.4% 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) (Loss) earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (28,172 ) (57,698 ) 2,082 Pre tax (loss) earnings from discontinued operations in 2009, 2008 and 2007 included operating (losses) income of $(11) million, $(12) million and $6 million, respectively.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 9,461 16,701 16,282 Dedicated Contract Carriage 11,597 15,102 14,966 Total $ 21,058 31,803 31,248 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) a summary of the 2009 and 2008 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MDA and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Continuing Operations Earnings Before Diluted Earnings Income Taxes Earnings per Share (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2009 Earnings / EPS from Continuing Operations $ 143,769 $ 90,117 $ 1.62 Restructuring and other charges 6,406 4,176 0.08 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (2,239 ) (0.04 ) Benefit from a tax law change in Ontario, Canada (4,100 ) (0.07 ) Charges related to impairment of international asset(1) 6,676 6,676 0.12 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 156,851 $ 94,630 $ 1.70 2008 Earnings / EPS from Continuing Operations $ 409,288 $ 257,579 $ 4.51 Restructuring and other charges 21,480 17,493 0.31 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (7,931 ) (0.14 ) Benefit from a tax law change primarily in Massachusetts (1,614 ) (0.03 ) Charges related to impairment of international asset(1) 1,617 1,617 0.03 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 432,385 $ 267,144 $ 4.68 (1) Refer to Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations were down 65% to $95 million in 2009. Comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations were down 64% to $1.70 in 2009. Results reflect significantly lower earnings in FMS, driven by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental and full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by higher pension expense. Earnings were favorably impacted by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Free cash flow was up 80% to $614 million in 2009. This increase reflects lower capital expenditures partially offset by lower earnings and higher pension contributions. With our strong cash flows, we repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares of common stock in 2009 for $116 million and made voluntary pension contributions of approximately $100 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 9% to $1.00 per share of common stock. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009. The decrease in capital expenditures reflects reduced full service lease vehicles spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current environment, and planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Our debt balances decreased 13% to $2.50 billion at December 31, 2009 due to the utilization of free cash flow to repay debt. Our debt to equity ratio also decreased to 175% from 213% in 2008. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also decreased to 183% from 225% in 2008. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 Outlook In 2010, we plan to manage through the cumulative impacts of a prolonged recession on full service lease, while driving benefits from actions taken in 2009 as well as new initiatives. Earnings per share growth is expected from improved commercial rental performance, productivity initiatives, better used vehicle sales operations, stronger SCS results, lower annual pension expense and the benefit of 2009 stock repurchases. These items are partially offset by significantly reduced full service lease results, the negative impact of vehicle residual value changes and some currently intended compensation restoration. Total revenue for the full year 2010 is forecast to be $4.90 billion, which is flat compared with 2009. Operating revenue for the full year 2010 is forecast to be down 2% to $4.00 billion compared with 2009. In FMS, core contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to decline 4%, or down 5% excluding foreign exchange, reflecting the cumulative effect of customer fleet downsizing. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 9%, driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. Total SCS revenue is forecast to decrease by 2%. SCS operating revenue is anticipated to decrease by 3%, or 6% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and fuel, reflecting the impact of non renewed contracts. Total DCC revenue is expected to be unchanged. DCC operating revenue is expected to decrease by 1%, or 2% excluding the impact of fuel due to lower freight volumes. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Revenue Reporting In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. This contract modification required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation beginning on January 1, 2008. This contract represented $640 million of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS We completed five FMS acquisitions in the past three years, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complemented our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) On December 19, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. (CRSA) in Canada, as well as CRSA operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. This strategic acquisition added complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.

Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million. NBT increased 2% in 2008 to $409 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 8% in 2008 to $432 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 8% to $267 million. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased 21% in 2008 to $200 million or $3.50 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2008 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $58 million. See subsequent discussion within Full Year Consolidated Results and Full Year Operating Results by Business Segment and refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for other items impacting comparability related to discontinued operations, restructuring and other charges and income taxes. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.00 billion in 2008 and was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.59 billion in 2008 primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. The increase in eliminations in 2008 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,229,539 2,959,518 2,739,952 (25)% 8% Percentage of revenue 46% 49% 43% 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. The reduction in fuel costs was driven by a decline in average U.S. fuel prices as well as lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in 2009 was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense increased 8% to $2.96 billion in 2008 as a result of higher fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs was due to higher average market prices. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,233,243 1,345,216 1,348,212 (8)% % Percentage of revenue 25% 22% 21% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 29% 30% Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, decreased 9% in 2009. The number of employees at December 31, 2009 decreased to approximately 22,900 compared to 25,500 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2008. The lower headcount was driven by reduced volumes in our SCS and DCC business segments and workforce reductions made as part of restructuring initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Pension expense totaled $66 million in 2009 compared to $2 million in 2008. Increased pension expense was primarily a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. Our Board of Directors has approved amendments to freeze U.K. and Canadian pension plans effective in 2010. The Canadian pension plan was frozen for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after the freeze and begin participating in defined contribution plans. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect 2010 pension expense to decrease approximately $23 million primarily because of higher than expected return on assets in 2009, the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the freeze of the U.K. and Canadian pension plans. However, we expect this pension decrease to be partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expense. Our 2010 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased slightly to $1.35 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. Pension expense decreased by $25 million as the result of a freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans; however, this benefit was partially offset by an increase of $20 million in defined contribution plan expense. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $198,860 233,106 868,437 (15)% (73)% Percentage of revenue 4% 4% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes in the current economic environment. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 73% to $233 million in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $881,216 836,149 810,544 5 % 3 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (12,292) (39,020) (44,090) (68 ) (11 ) Equipment rental 65,828 78,292 86,415 (16 ) (9 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $24 million, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010, the impact of recent acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. Depreciation expense increased 3% to $836 million in 2008 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2009, based on current and expected market conditions, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $10 million in 2009. At the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 and 2007 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the decline in market performance of our investment securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains compared to losses in 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These items were partially offset by higher professional fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 Outlook In 2010, we plan to manage through the cumulative impacts of a prolonged recession on full service lease, while driving benefits from actions taken in 2009 as well as new initiatives. Earnings per share growth is expected from improved commercial rental performance, productivity initiatives, better used vehicle sales operations, stronger SCS results, lower annual pension expense and the benefit of 2009 stock repurchases. These items are partially offset by significantly reduced full service lease results, the negative impact of vehicle residual value changes and some currently intended compensation restoration. Total revenue for the full year 2010 is forecast to be $4.90 billion, which is flat compared with 2009. Operating revenue for the full year 2010 is forecast to be down 2% to $4.00 billion compared with 2009. In FMS, core contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to decline 4%, or down 5% excluding foreign exchange, reflecting the cumulative effect of customer fleet downsizing. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 9%, driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. Total SCS revenue is forecast to decrease by 2%. SCS operating revenue is anticipated to decrease by 3%, or 6% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and fuel, reflecting the impact of non renewed contracts. Total DCC revenue is expected to be unchanged. DCC operating revenue is expected to decrease by 1%, or 2% excluding the impact of fuel due to lower freight volumes. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Revenue Reporting In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation services billed to our customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross (within total revenue) or net (deducted from total revenue) is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. This contract modification required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation beginning on January 1, 2008. This contract represented $640 million of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS We completed five FMS acquisitions in the past three years, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complemented our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) On December 19, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. (CRSA) in Canada, as well as CRSA operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. This strategic acquisition added complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.

Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million. NBT increased 2% in 2008 to $409 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 8% in 2008 to $432 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 8% to $267 million. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased 21% in 2008 to $200 million or $3.50 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2008 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $58 million.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.00 billion in 2008 and was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.59 billion in 2008 primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. The increase in eliminations in 2008 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,229,539 2,959,518 2,739,952 (25)% 8% Percentage of revenue 46% 49% 43% 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. The reduction in fuel costs was driven by a decline in average U.S. fuel prices as well as lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in 2009 was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense increased 8% to $2.96 billion in 2008 as a result of higher fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs was due to higher average market prices. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,233,243 1,345,216 1,348,212 (8)% % Percentage of revenue 25% 22% 21% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 29% 30% Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, decreased 9% in 2009. The number of employees at December 31, 2009 decreased to approximately 22,900 compared to 25,500 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2008. The lower headcount was driven by reduced volumes in our SCS and DCC business segments and workforce reductions made as part of restructuring initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Pension expense totaled $66 million in 2009 compared to $2 million in 2008. Increased pension expense was primarily a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. Our Board of Directors has approved amendments to freeze U.K. and Canadian pension plans effective in 2010. The Canadian pension plan was frozen for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after the freeze and begin participating in defined contribution plans. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect 2010 pension expense to decrease approximately $23 million primarily because of higher than expected return on assets in 2009, the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the freeze of the U.K. and Canadian pension plans. However, we expect this pension decrease to be partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expense. Our 2010 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased slightly to $1.35 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. Pension expense decreased by $25 million as the result of a freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans; however, this benefit was partially offset by an increase of $20 million in defined contribution plan expense. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $198,860 233,106 868,437 (15)% (73)% Percentage of revenue 4% 4% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes in the current economic environment. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 73% to $233 million in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $881,216 836,149 810,544 5 % 3 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (12,292) (39,020) (44,090) (68 ) (11 ) Equipment rental 65,828 78,292 86,415 (16 ) (9 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $24 million, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010, the impact of recent acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. Depreciation expense increased 3% to $836 million in 2008 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2009, based on current and expected market conditions, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $10 million in 2009. At the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 and 2007 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions.

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) On December 19, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. (CRSA) in Canada, as well as CRSA operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. This strategic acquisition added complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.

Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million. NBT increased 2% in 2008 to $409 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 8% in 2008 to $432 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 8% to $267 million. The improvement in comparable NBT was driven by better operating performance in our FMS contractual business partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and reduced profitability in our SCS business segment. Net earnings decreased 21% in 2008 to $200 million or $3.50 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2008 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $58 million.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.00 billion in 2008 and was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.59 billion in 2008 primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. The increase in eliminations in 2008 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,229,539 2,959,518 2,739,952 (25)% 8% Percentage of revenue 46% 49% 43% 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. The reduction in fuel costs was driven by a decline in average U.S. fuel prices as well as lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in 2009 was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense increased 8% to $2.96 billion in 2008 as a result of higher fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs was due to higher average market prices. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,233,243 1,345,216 1,348,212 (8)% % Percentage of revenue 25% 22% 21% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 29% 30% Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, decreased 9% in 2009. The number of employees at December 31, 2009 decreased to approximately 22,900 compared to 25,500 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2008. The lower headcount was driven by reduced volumes in our SCS and DCC business segments and workforce reductions made as part of restructuring initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Pension expense totaled $66 million in 2009 compared to $2 million in 2008. Increased pension expense was primarily a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. Our Board of Directors has approved amendments to freeze U.K. and Canadian pension plans effective in 2010. The Canadian pension plan was frozen for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after the freeze and begin participating in defined contribution plans. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect 2010 pension expense to decrease approximately $23 million primarily because of higher than expected return on assets in 2009, the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the freeze of the U.K. and Canadian pension plans. However, we expect this pension decrease to be partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expense. Our 2010 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased slightly to $1.35 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. Pension expense decreased by $25 million as the result of a freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans; however, this benefit was partially offset by an increase of $20 million in defined contribution plan expense. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $198,860 233,106 868,437 (15)% (73)% Percentage of revenue 4% 4% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes in the current economic environment. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 73% to $233 million in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $881,216 836,149 810,544 5 % 3 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (12,292) (39,020) (44,090) (68 ) (11 ) Equipment rental 65,828 78,292 86,415 (16 ) (9 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $24 million, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010, the impact of recent acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. Depreciation expense increased 3% to $836 million in 2008 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2009, based on current and expected market conditions, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $10 million in 2009. At the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 and 2007 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

Interest expense decreased 2% to $152 million in 2008 because of lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.6 million. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $ (3,657 ) 2,564 (15,309 ) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the decline in market performance of our investment securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains compared to losses in 2007. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 10,795 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs.

Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Total revenue decreased 6% to $6.00 billion in 2008 and was impacted by a change, effective January 1, 2008, in our contractual relationship with a significant customer that required a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis for subcontracted transportation. This change did not impact operating revenue or earnings. During 2007, total revenue from this contractual relationship was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue increased 5% during 2008 primarily as a result of higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.59 billion in 2008 primarily due to FMS contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total revenue in 2008 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.3% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. The increase in eliminations in 2008 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,229,539 2,959,518 2,739,952 (25)% 8% Percentage of revenue 46% 49% 43% 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. The reduction in fuel costs was driven by a decline in average U.S. fuel prices as well as lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in 2009 was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense increased 8% to $2.96 billion in 2008 as a result of higher fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs was due to higher average market prices. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,233,243 1,345,216 1,348,212 (8)% % Percentage of revenue 25% 22% 21% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 29% 30% Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, decreased 9% in 2009. The number of employees at December 31, 2009 decreased to approximately 22,900 compared to 25,500 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2008. The lower headcount was driven by reduced volumes in our SCS and DCC business segments and workforce reductions made as part of restructuring initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Pension expense totaled $66 million in 2009 compared to $2 million in 2008. Increased pension expense was primarily a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. Our Board of Directors has approved amendments to freeze U.K. and Canadian pension plans effective in 2010. The Canadian pension plan was frozen for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after the freeze and begin participating in defined contribution plans. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect 2010 pension expense to decrease approximately $23 million primarily because of higher than expected return on assets in 2009, the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the freeze of the U.K. and Canadian pension plans. However, we expect this pension decrease to be partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expense. Our 2010 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased slightly to $1.35 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. Pension expense decreased by $25 million as the result of a freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans; however, this benefit was partially offset by an increase of $20 million in defined contribution plan expense. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $198,860 233,106 868,437 (15)% (73)% Percentage of revenue 4% 4% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes in the current economic environment. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 73% to $233 million in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $881,216 836,149 810,544 5 % 3 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (12,292) (39,020) (44,090) (68 ) (11 ) Equipment rental 65,828 78,292 86,415 (16 ) (9 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $24 million, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010, the impact of recent acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. Depreciation expense increased 3% to $836 million in 2008 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2009, based on current and expected market conditions, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $10 million in 2009. At the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 and 2007 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

Interest expense decreased 2% to $152 million in 2008 because of lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.6 million. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $ (3,657 ) 2,564 (15,309 ) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the decline in market performance of our investment securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains compared to losses in 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 9,461 16,701 16,282 Dedicated Contract Carriage 11,597 15,102 14,966 Total $ 21,058 31,803 31,248 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs.

Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. The reduction in fuel costs was driven by a decline in average U.S. fuel prices as well as lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in 2009 was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. In recent years, our development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves for the reasons noted above. Operating expense increased 8% to $2.96 billion in 2008 as a result of higher fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs was due to higher average market prices. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,233,243 1,345,216 1,348,212 (8)% % Percentage of revenue 25% 22% 21% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 29% 30% Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, decreased 9% in 2009. The number of employees at December 31, 2009 decreased to approximately 22,900 compared to 25,500 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2008. The lower headcount was driven by reduced volumes in our SCS and DCC business segments and workforce reductions made as part of restructuring initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Pension expense totaled $66 million in 2009 compared to $2 million in 2008. Increased pension expense was primarily a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. Our Board of Directors has approved amendments to freeze U.K. and Canadian pension plans effective in 2010. The Canadian pension plan was frozen for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result, these employees will cease accruing further benefits after the freeze and begin participating in defined contribution plans. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding these items. We expect 2010 pension expense to decrease approximately $23 million primarily because of higher than expected return on assets in 2009, the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the freeze of the U.K. and Canadian pension plans. However, we expect this pension decrease to be partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expense. Our 2010 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased slightly to $1.35 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower headcount, including cost savings initiatives from 2007. Average headcount decreased 3% in 2008 compared with 2007. Pension expense decreased by $25 million as the result of a freeze of our U.S. and Canadian pension plans; however, this benefit was partially offset by an increase of $20 million in defined contribution plan expense. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes in the current economic environment. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 73% to $233 million in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $881,216 836,149 810,544 5 % 3 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (12,292) (39,020) (44,090) (68 ) (11 ) Equipment rental 65,828 78,292 86,415 (16 ) (9 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $24 million, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010, the impact of recent acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. Depreciation expense increased 3% to $836 million in 2008 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2009, based on current and expected market conditions, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $10 million in 2009. At the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 and 2007 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

Interest expense decreased 2% to $152 million in 2008 because of lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.6 million. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $ (3,657 ) 2,564 (15,309 ) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the decline in market performance of our investment securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains compared to losses in 2007. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 10,795 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,143 329,875 330,198 (20 )% % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 165,915 227,616 253,138 (27 )% (10 )% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 22,900 25,700 25,600 (11 )% % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 68.0 % 71.4 % 71.0 % (340 ) bps 40 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue.

Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $198,860 233,106 868,437 (15)% (73)% Percentage of revenue 4% 4% 14% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes in the current economic environment. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 73% to $233 million in 2008 as a result of net reporting from a contract change. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, the amount of total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense for this particular customer contract. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $881,216 836,149 810,544 5 % 3 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (12,292) (39,020) (44,090) (68 ) (11 ) Equipment rental 65,828 78,292 86,415 (16 ) (9 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $24 million, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010, the impact of recent acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. Depreciation expense increased 3% to $836 million in 2008 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and increased capital spending. These increases were partially offset by lower write downs in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale of $13 million. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2009, based on current and expected market conditions, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2010. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $10 million in 2009. At the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, we completed our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 and 2007 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties. Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $144,342 152,448 155,970 (5)% (2)% Effective interest rate 5.4% 5.3% 5.5% Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. Interest expense decreased 2% to $152 million in 2008 because of lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.6 million. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $ (3,657 ) 2,564 (15,309 ) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the decline in market performance of our investment securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains compared to losses in 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 9,461 16,701 16,282 Dedicated Contract Carriage 11,597 15,102 14,966 Total $ 21,058 31,803 31,248 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These items were partially offset by higher professional fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) January 1, 2010. The residual value changes will decrease pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 11% to $39 million in 2008 due to a 32% decline in the number of vehicles sold partially offset by improved gains per unit sold. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 and decreased 9% to $78 million in 2008 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

Interest expense decreased 2% to $152 million in 2008 because of lower average cost of debt principally from lower commercial paper borrowing rates. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.6 million. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $ (3,657 ) 2,564 (15,309 ) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Miscellaneous expense (income), net decreased $18 million in 2008 primarily due to a $10 million gain on sale of property recognized in the prior year. See Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the property sale. Miscellaneous expense in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $6 million due to the decline in market performance of our investment securities and was partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains compared to losses in 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) (Loss) earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (28,172 ) (57,698 ) 2,082 Pre tax (loss) earnings from discontinued operations in 2009, 2008 and 2007 included operating (losses) income of $(11) million, $(12) million and $6 million, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we also incurred $17 million, $47 million, and $2 million, respectively, of pre tax restructuring and other charges (primarily exit related) related to discontinued operations.

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,143 329,875 330,198 (20 )% % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 165,915 227,616 253,138 (27 )% (10 )% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 22,900 25,700 25,600 (11 )% % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 68.0 % 71.4 % 71.0 % (340 ) bps 40 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% of pre tax earnings. The current year tax rate benefits were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. The 2007 effective income tax rate included a net tax benefit of $5 million (1.4% of pre tax earnings) from the reduction of deferred income taxes as a result of enacted changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to comparable earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 which was not provided within the MDA discussion: Years ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 402,204 390,275 357,377 Net restructuring charges 9,290 Pension accounting charge 5,872 Gain on sale of property (10,110 ) Comparable earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 401,384 396,147 357,377 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 9,461 16,701 16,282 Dedicated Contract Carriage 11,597 15,102 14,966 Total $ 21,058 31,803 31,248 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,143 329,875 330,198 (20 )% % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 165,915 227,616 253,138 (27 )% (10 )% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 22,900 25,700 25,600 (11 )% % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 68.0 % 71.4 % 71.0 % (340 ) bps 40 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) pricing.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs.

Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results.

Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in the past year, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. We expect unfavorable contractual revenue comparisons next year based on the carryover effect of 2009 fleet downsizings actions. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. In light of current economic conditions, we expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing and improved utilization. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2009/ 2008/ 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 265,143 329,875 330,198 (20 )% % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $ 165,915 227,616 253,138 (27 )% (10 )% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service(2),(3) 22,900 25,700 25,600 (11 )% % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 68.0 % 71.4 % 71.0 % (340 ) bps 40 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the current economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Customers also operated fewer miles with their existing fleets, which lowered our variable revenue and fuel gallons sold. However, lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement in the second half of the year. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. However, our used vehicle inventory levels improved during the second half of the year and our year end inventory counts were 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue increased 7% in 2008 to $4.45 billion due to higher fuel services revenue and contractual revenue growth. Fuel services revenue increased 20% in 2008 because of higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced fuel volumes. Operating revenue increased 2% in 2008 to $3.04 billion as a result of contractual revenue growth, including acquisitions, which more than offset a decline in commercial rental revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2008 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was realized in both contractual FMS product lines in 2008. Full service lease revenue grew 4% reflecting increases in the North American market primarily due to acquisitions. Contract maintenance revenue increased 5% due primarily to new contract sales. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2008, reflecting weak global market demand and reduced pricing particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The average global rental fleet size declined 5% in 2008 compared with 2007. FMS NBT increased 7% in 2008 to $396 million due primarily to improved contractual business performance, including acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, from higher fuel margins associated with unusually volatile fuel prices and better used vehicle sales results. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, as weak market demand drove lower 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved $9 million in 2008 primarily because of lower average used vehicle inventories.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs.

Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs.

These items were partially offset by higher professional fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased compared with prior year consistent with lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased compared with the prior year because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. For 2008, the number of NLE units increased slightly compared with the prior year because of the decline in commercial rental demand. We expect NLE levels in 2010 to be consistent with 2009.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These items were partially offset by higher professional fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year reflecting the impact of non renewed automotive contracts. General Motors Corporation (GM) accounted for approximately 13% and 14% of SCS total and operating revenue in 2009, respectively, and is comprised of multiple contracts in North America. In the U.S., we provide supply chain management and other transportation related solutions supporting twelve GM plants and operations; three of these operations closed in 2009 as a result of GMs U.S. reorganization plan. For 2009, revenue associated with the three closed Ryder supported GM locations totaled approximately $20 million, representing 2% of SCS revenue and 14% of GM revenue. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy, including our largest customer, GM. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue decreased 30% in 2008 to $1.43 billion as a result of net reporting of a transportation management arrangement previously reported on a gross basis. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship with a significant customer for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent based on the revised terms of the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased by $640 million in 2008. Operating revenue grew 2% due to new and expanded business and higher fuel cost pass throughs and was offset by lower automotive volumes, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, GM accounted for approximately 16% and 18% of SCS total and operating revenue, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 5% in 2008 to $57 million largely driven by lower operating results related to the start up of a U.S. based operation. NBT was also impacted by higher overhead spending from increased sales and marketing investments and facility relocation costs slightly offset by lower incentive based compensation. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

These items were partially offset by higher professional fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Subcontracted transportation is excluded from our operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to customers. We realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. We expect unfavorable operating revenue comparisons next year because of slightly lower freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 2008 versus 2007 Total revenue declined 4% in 2008 to $548 million and operating revenue declined 3% in 2008 to $537 million as a result of the non renewal of certain customer contracts partially offset by the pass through of higher fuel costs. DCC NBT increased 5% in 2008 to $50 million as a result of better operating performance partially offset by higher safety and insurance costs. The increase in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

These items were partially offset by higher professional fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 2008 versus 2007 Total and unallocated CSS costs decreased 3% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 to $185 million and $38 million, respectively, because of lower foreign currency transaction losses, reduced severance costs and lower share based compensation expense due to a 2007 charge related to the accelerated amortization of restricted stock unit expense. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The decrease in total revenue was also impacted by lower fuel volumes and, to a lesser extent, fuel prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue decreased 6% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower full service lease and commercial rental revenue and lower automotive volumes partially offset by favorable exchange movements. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. NBT from continuing operations decreased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $32 million which reflects significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global full service lease results, higher pension expense, reduced global commercial rental performance and lower results from used vehicle sales operations. To a lesser extent, earnings in our SCS and DCC business segments were impacted by higher self insurance costs. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included an income tax benefit of $4 million or $0.07 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 included an income tax benefit of $8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share associated with reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions. We previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, we ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 including accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14 million ($14 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted common share) associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $42 million in the fourth 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) quarter of 2008 and included $41 million of restructuring charges and other items primarily related to severance and employee related costs, impairment charge and contract termination costs.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Operating revenue decreased 5% to $699 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of lower full service lease revenue from customer fleet downsizings and lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. FMS total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. FMS NBT decreased 63% to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflecting lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue decreased 5% to $302 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 9% to $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. In the fourth quarter of 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue both included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2%. SCS NBT decreased 31% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and shutdown costs related to the termination of certain automotive operations. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue decreased 6% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and operating revenue decreased 8% to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes. DCC NBT decreased 46% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher self insurance costs compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year and a decline in revenue. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs increased 25% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of higher professional fees associated with cost savings initiatives. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Financing activities (542,016 ) (148,152 ) (304,600 ) Investing activities (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) (811,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,794 1,408 6,734 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,876 ) (2,043 ) (12,509 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $263 million in 2009 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased $394 million in 2009 reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased $655 million in 2009 compared primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $152 million in 2008 because of higher cash based earnings and reduced working capital needs primarily from improved accounts receivable collections. Cash used in financing activities decreased $156 million in 2008 because of higher borrowing needs to fund net capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased $292 million in 2008 primarily due to acquisition related payments and lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment which included proceeds of $150 million from a sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This increase was partially offset by lower vehicle capital spending. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment and operating property and equipment, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment, collections on direct finance leases and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 984,956 1,248,169 1,096,559 Sales of revenue earning equipment 211,002 257,679 354,736 Sales of operating property and equipment 4,634 3,727 18,725 Collections on direct finance leases 65,242 61,096 62,346 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 150,348 Other, net 209 395 1,588 Total cash generated 1,266,043 1,571,066 1,684,302 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) (1,304,033 ) Free cash flow $ 614,090 340,665 380,269 Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Free cash flow decreased to $341 million in 2008 compared with $380 million in 2007 because of lower proceeds from sales of revenue earning equipment, primarily from the $150 million sale leaseback transaction in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by higher cash flows from operations and lower cash payments for vehicle capital spending. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately $250 million reflecting higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower pension contributions. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and up to ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 547,750 985,924 888,734 Commercial rental 7,436 171,128 218,830 555,186 1,157,052 1,107,564 Operating property and equipment 56,216 108,284 74,069 Total capital expenditures(1) 611,402 1,265,336 1,181,633 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 40,551 (34,935 ) 122,400 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 651,953 1,230,401 1,304,033 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million, $1 million, and $11 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Capital expenditures increased 7% to $1.27 billion in 2008 as a result of higher full service lease spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets and reduced spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles to meet market demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh an aging commercial rental fleet. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 880,373 $ 957,581 Current liabilities 850,274 1,111,165 Working capital $ 30,099 $ (153,584 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $30 million at December 31, 2009 compared with negative $154 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a decrease of $152 million in short term debt. Excluding the decline in short term debt, working capital increased $32 million in 2009 because of the payment of restructuring related reserves and incentive compensation. This increase was partially offset by a decline in accounts receivables as we discontinued operations and experienced volume declines. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (reaffirmed February 2009) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Negative (lowered January 2009) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (reaffirmed March 2009) We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or entirely. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. In April 2009, we executed a new $875 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. This facility replaced a $870 million credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2010. The new global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. This fee ranges from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points and is based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2009 was 155%. At December 31, 2009, $681 million was available under the credit facility. At December 31, 2009, no foreign borrowings were outstanding under the facility. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn may sell, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. In October 2009, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sale program. The available proceeds amount that may be received under the program was reduced at that time from $250 million to $175 million at our election based on our projected financing requirements. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 29, 2010. The program contains provisions restricting its availability 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. At December 31, 2008, $190 million was outstanding under the program and was included within Short term debt and current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, the amount of collateralized receivables under the program was $210 million. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we sell beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and allows us to access the public asset backed securities market for three years, subject to market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we do not expect to utilize this program in the near term. On February 27, 2007, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. We intend to file a new shelf registration with the SEC before the current registration statement expires. In August 2008, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in September 2015. The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our other outstanding unsecured U.S. notes are not subject to change of control repurchase obligations. See Note 16, Debt, for other issuances under this registration statement. In September 2009, we completed a $100 million debt tender offer at a total cost of $104 million. We purchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% medium term notes maturing May 2011 and $50 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.625% medium term notes maturing April 2010. We recorded a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of $4 million which included $3 million for the premium paid, and $1 million for the write off of unamortized original debt discount and issuance costs and fees on the transaction. At December 31, 2009, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 681 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2009 2008 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,862,799 2,776,129 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 148,256 (522,312 ) Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 550,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 2,014 194,004 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (276,000 ) (90,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (243,710 ) (28,641 ) Net change from discontinued operations (9,427 ) (2,478 ) (378,867 ) 100,573 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (6,290 ) 18,391 Addition of capital lease obligations 1,949 1,430 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 18,100 (33,724 ) Total changes in debt (365,108 ) 86,670 Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 26% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2009 of Equity 2008 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,497,691 175% $ 2,862,799 213% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 118,828 163,039 Total obligations $ 2,616,519 183% $ 3,025,838 225% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The decrease in our leverage ratios in 2009 was driven by reduced funding needs to support our contractual full service lease business and our commercial rental business. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In May 2007, we completed a sale leaseback transaction of revenue earning equipment with a third party and this transaction qualified for off balance sheet operating lease treatment. Proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction totaled $150 million. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, and we accrued $9 million in 2009 and $1 million in 2008, as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 230,752 871,995 611,763 772,170 2,486,680 Capital lease obligations 1,865 3,356 3,456 2,334 11,011 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 232,617 875,351 615,219 774,504 2,497,691 Interest on debt(2) 122,191 192,125 122,864 167,551 604,731 Operating leases(3) 79,234 149,743 75,357 34,041 338,375 Purchase obligations(4) 214,829 20,100 10,997 12,674 258,600 Total contractual cash obligations 416,254 361,968 209,218 214,266 1,201,706 Insurance obligations(5) 111,144 90,779 34,568 25,698 262,189 Other long term liabilities(6),(7),(8) 8,707 2,368 1,756 45,044 57,875 Total $ 768,722 1,330,466 860,761 1,059,512 4,019,461 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2009. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. (5) Insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals. (6) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (7) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2010, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $17 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2010 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years is approximately $337 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (8) The amounts exclude $76 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years, we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants will cease accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and will begin receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date will be fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2009 or 2007. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $412 million and $480 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower equity charge in 2009 reflects higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2009. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 23% in 2009. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2009, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $131 million compared with $21 million in 2008. We made voluntary pension contributions of $102 million in 2009. We estimate 2010 required pension contributions will be $17 million. After considering the 2009 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $286 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2009, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 5% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $28 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends As discussed in Note 20, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Under the December 2009 program, management is authorized to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees under the Companys various employee stock, stock option and employee stock purchase plans from December 1, 2009 through December 15, 2011. The December 2009 program limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Management may establish prearranged written plans for the Company under Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as part of the December 2009 program, which allow for share repurchases during Ryders quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in 2009. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million discretionary share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized a separate two year anti dilutive repurchase program. The anti dilutive program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than 2 million shares of Ryder common stock. Towards the end of the third quarter of 2008, we paused purchases under both programs given market conditions at that time. We resumed purchases under both programs in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the end of the programs two year terms. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 2,348,909 shares and 2,615,000 shares, respectively, under the $300 million program at an aggregate cost of $100 million and $170 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased and retired 377,372 shares and 1,363,436 shares, respectively, under the anti dilutive program at an aggregate cost of $16 million and $86 million, respectively. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $53 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $50 million in 2007. During 2009, we increased our annual dividend to $1.00 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Financial Instruments and Risk Management, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At December 31, 2009, we had $1.90 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $1.99 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2009 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2009. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2009, we had $591 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.90%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2009 was recorded as an asset totaling $12 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2009 was $605 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2009 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $1 million. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $2 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. However, we had a $78 million cross currency swap in place to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary which matured in 2007. As of December 31, 2009 the accumulated derivative net loss in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $17 million, net of tax, and will be recognized in earnings upon sale or repatriation of our net investment. At December 31, 2008, we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of negative $0.6 million used to hedge the variability of foreign currency equivalent cash flows. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2009, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We periodically review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2010 by approximately $98 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2009, we will adjust the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value change will decrease earnings in 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2009, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2010 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2009, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.9% from 8.4% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities and other investments, considering the reallocation of excess cash. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $638 million at the end of 2009 compared with a loss of $750 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in the net actuarial loss in 2009 resulted primarily from higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The freeze of the qualified U.S. pension plan caused almost all of the plans participants to become inactive on January 1, 2008. Consequently, by rule, the amortization period for actuarial losses on the qualified U.S. pension plan was changed to the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants (28 years) resulting in an extended amortization period. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2010 and future years will be $478 million. The effect on years beyond 2010 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2009 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of projected 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2009 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $0.5 million $37 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $0.3 million + $37 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million and $256 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. In recent years, our actual claim development has been favorable compared with historical selected loss development factors because of improved safety performance, payment patterns and settlement patterns. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recorded a benefit of $1 million, $23 million, and $24 million, respectively, to reduce estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2009, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2010 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2009, goodwill totaled $216 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2009 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2009, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $4 million to approximately $315 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $3 million to approximately $214 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. The accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings. Accordingly, the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Effective January 1, 2008, our contractual relationship for certain transportation management services changed, and we determined, after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services, that we were acting as an agent in the arrangement. As a result, total revenue and subcontracted transportation expense decreased in 2008 due to the reporting of revenue net of subcontracted transportation expense. During 2007, revenue associated with this portion of the contract was $640 million. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return.

Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $320 million and $405 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $37 million and $35 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
