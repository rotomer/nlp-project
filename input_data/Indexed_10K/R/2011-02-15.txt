ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. The following MDA describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations, and critical accounting estimates. OVERVIEW Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our business is divided into three business segments, which operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology, and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, food service, electronics, transportation, grocery, lumber and wood products, and home furnishing. The Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing, contract maintenance, contract related maintenance, and commercial rental of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. FMS revenue and assets in 2010 were $3.40 billion and $5.94 billion, respectively, representing 66% of our consolidated revenue and 89% of consolidated assets. The Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting including distribution and transportation services throughout North America and Asia. SCS revenue in 2010 was $1.25 billion, representing 24% of our consolidated revenue. The Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S. DCC revenue in 2010 was $483 million, representing 10% of our consolidated revenue. In 2010, we had a very successful year. In what continues to be an uneven, slow economic recovery, we achieved revenue growth and very good earnings leverage, including a 38% increase in net earnings from continuing operations and a 24% increase in comparable earnings from continuing operations. Our steady progress throughout the year, culminating in a particularly strong fourth quarter, enabled Ryder to deliver an increase in total shareholder value. In Fleet Management Solutions, our commercial rental performance improved because of better pricing due to rising demand in the overall marketplace. Used vehicle sales results improved because of better pricing stemming from a lower supply of vehicles for sale in the marketplace and higher demand. Our full service lease product line continued to improve in miles driven per vehicle; however, customers remain cautious on entering long term leases. Our Supply Chain solutions business delivered solid margins with particularly strong results from our high tech and automotive accounts. Our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow enabled us to announce several strategic acquisitions which will help grow and expand capabilities in all three business segments. Additionally, our financial strength enabled us to continue repurchasing shares under the previously announced stock buyback programs and increase our annual dividend. Total revenue was $5.14 billion, up 5% from $4.89 billion in 2009. Operating revenue (total revenue less FMS fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $4.16 billion in 2010, up 2%. Operating revenue increased primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $125 million in 2010 from $90 million in 2009 and earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations increased to $2.37 from $1.62 in 2009. Earnings from continuing operations included certain items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations and have been excluded from our comparable earnings measure. The following discussion provides 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) a summary of the 2010 and 2009 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MDA and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Continuing Operations Earnings Before Diluted Earnings Income Taxes Earnings per Share (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2010 Earnings/EPS from continuing operations $ 186,305 $ 124,608 $ 2.37 Tax benefit associated with settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation (10,771 ) (0.21 ) Gain on sale of an international asset previously impaired(1) (946 ) (946 ) (0.02 ) Acquisition costs(1) 4,097 4,097 0.08 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 189,456 $ 116,988 $ 2.22 2009 Earnings/EPS from continuing operations $ 143,769 $ 90,117 $ 1.62 Restructuring and other charges 6,406 4,176 0.08 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (2,239 ) (0.04 ) Benefit from a tax law change in Ontario, Canada (4,100 ) (0.07 ) Charges related to impairment of international asset(1) 6,676 6,676 0.12 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 156,851 $ 94,630 $ 1.70 (1) Refer to Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $117 million in 2010. Comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations increased 31% to $2.22 in 2010. Results reflect higher earnings in our FMS and SCS business segments. The FMS earnings increase was driven by improved global commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. This increase was partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. SCS earnings increased due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. Free cash flow was $258 million in 2010 compared to $614 million in 2009. The decline was driven by higher capital expenditures. With our stronger earnings and positive cash flows, we repurchased a total of 3 million shares of common stock in 2010 for $123 million and made voluntary pension contributions of approximately $50 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.08 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2010 we paid $205 million to acquire Total Logistic Control. Capital expenditures increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 and reflects increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Our debt balances increased 10% to $2.75 billion at December 31, 2010 due to acquisitions and higher vehicle capital spending levels. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 196% from 175% in 2009. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also increased to 203% from 183% in 2009. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 Outlook We enter 2011 very well positioned to profitably grow the business. For 2011, we expect to see the continuation of many of the same positive trends we experienced in 2010. We plan to benefit from productivity initiatives and operational efficiencies in our FMS business. This benefit will be partially offset by higher maintenance costs as our fleet continues to age. Earnings per share growth is expected from continued improvement in commercial rental performance, the impact of acquisitions, continued strong used vehicle sales results and the benefit of 2010 stock repurchases. Total revenue for the full year 2011 is forecast to be $5.73 billion, which is an increase of 12% compared with 2010. In FMS, contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to increase 2%. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 19%, driven by strong demand and higher pricing. Total SCS revenue is forecast to increase by 25% reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Total DCC revenue is expected to increase by 14% reflecting the impact of the Scully acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS On December 31, 2010, we acquired Total Logistic Control (TLC), which is a leading provider of comprehensive supply chain solutions to food, beverage, and consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers in the U.S. TLC provides customers a broad suite of end to end services, including distribution management, contract packaging services and solutions engineering. This acquisition will enhance our SCS capabilities and growth prospects in the areas of packaging and warehousing, including temperature controlled facilities. We completed four FMS acquisitions from 2008 to 2009, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition. Contractual Company Acquired Date Vehicles Customers Market Edart Leasing LLC February 2, 2009 1,600 340 Northeast U.S. Gordon Truck Leasing August 29, 2008 500 130 Pennsylvania Gator Leasing, Inc. May 12, 2008 2,300 300 Florida Lily Transportation Corp. January 11, 2008 1,600 200 Northeast U.S. On December 19, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. (CRSA) in Canada, as well as CRSA operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. This strategic acquisition added complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 21% in 2010 to $189 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $117 million. The increase in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects the impact of stronger results in our FMS and SCS business segments. FMS earnings increased due to improved global commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. This increase was partially offset by lower full service lease performance reflecting higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. SCS earnings increased due to improved high tech and global automotive industry volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. Net earnings increased 91% in 2010 to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2010 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $6 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. Earnings per share growth in 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $144 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflected significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global SCS automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million or $0.51 per diluted common share. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $3,712,153 3,567,836 4,454,251 4 % (20 )% Supply Chain Solutions 1,252,251 1,139,911 1,429,632 10 (20 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 482,583 470,956 547,751 2 (14 ) Eliminations (310,552 ) (291,449 ) (432,593 ) (7 ) 33 Total $5,136,435 4,887,254 5,999,041 5 % (19 )% Operating revenue(1) $4,158,239 4,062,512 4,590,080 2 % (11 )% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 5% to $5.14 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher fuel services revenue, operating revenue and subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.16 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increase in eliminations in 2010 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,441,924 2,229,539 2,959,518 10% (25)% Percentage of revenue 48% 46% 49% Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased in 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel costs and higher maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was driven by an increase in average U.S. fuel prices on lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. Operating expense decreased 25% to $2.23 billion in 2009 as a result of lower fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was due to lower average market prices and lower fuel volumes. The decrease was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,255,659 1,233,243 1,345,216 2% (8)% Percentage of revenue 24% 25% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 29% Salaries and employee related costs increased 2% to $1.26 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher incentive based compensation, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher driver costs, partially offset by lower retirement plans expense. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, increased 1% in 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2010 increased to approximately 25,900 compared to 22,900 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2009. The higher headcount was primarily due to the acquisition of TLC at the end of the year. Pension expense totaled $42 million in 2010 compared to $66 million in 2009. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2009 and the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect 2011 pension expense to decrease approximately $9 million primarily because of reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on plan assets in 2010. Our 2011 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount decreased 9% in 2009 compared with 2008. Pension expense increased by $65 million as a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $261,325 198,860 233,106 31% (15)% Percentage of revenue 5% 4% 4% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense increased 31% to $261 million in 2010 as a result of increased freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $833,841 881,216 836,149 (5 )% 5 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (28,727) (12,292) (39,020) 134 (68 ) Equipment rental 63,228 65,828 78,292 (4 ) (16 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense decreased 5% to $834 million in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale. The decline was also impacted by a prior year impairment charge on a Singapore facility. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs of $24 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be held for sale through 2010, the impact of acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2010 and 2009, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2011. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $5 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of each year, we complete our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $129,994 144,342 152,448 (10 )% (5 )% Effective interest rate 5.2% 5.4% 5.3% Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $(7,114 ) (3,657 ) 2,564 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery partially offset by lower income on investment securities. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 61,697 53,652 151,709 15 % (65 )% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 33.1% 37.3% 37.1% The 2010 effective income tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of domestic tax audits in 2010 and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of a statute of limitation. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (6,438 ) (28,172 ) (57,698 ) Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily included exit costs related to a leased facility and adverse legal developments. Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 included operating losses of $11 million and $12 million, respectively.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 8,426 9,461 16,701 Dedicated Contract Carriage 10,849 11,597 15,102 Total $ 19,275 21,058 31,803 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) a summary of the 2010 and 2009 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MDA and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Continuing Operations Earnings Before Diluted Earnings Income Taxes Earnings per Share (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2010 Earnings/EPS from continuing operations $ 186,305 $ 124,608 $ 2.37 Tax benefit associated with settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation (10,771 ) (0.21 ) Gain on sale of an international asset previously impaired(1) (946 ) (946 ) (0.02 ) Acquisition costs(1) 4,097 4,097 0.08 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 189,456 $ 116,988 $ 2.22 2009 Earnings/EPS from continuing operations $ 143,769 $ 90,117 $ 1.62 Restructuring and other charges 6,406 4,176 0.08 Benefit associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions (2,239 ) (0.04 ) Benefit from a tax law change in Ontario, Canada (4,100 ) (0.07 ) Charges related to impairment of international asset(1) 6,676 6,676 0.12 Comparable earnings from continuing operations $ 156,851 $ 94,630 $ 1.70 (1) Refer to Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $117 million in 2010. Comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations increased 31% to $2.22 in 2010. Results reflect higher earnings in our FMS and SCS business segments. The FMS earnings increase was driven by improved global commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. This increase was partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. SCS earnings increased due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. Free cash flow was $258 million in 2010 compared to $614 million in 2009. The decline was driven by higher capital expenditures. With our stronger earnings and positive cash flows, we repurchased a total of 3 million shares of common stock in 2010 for $123 million and made voluntary pension contributions of approximately $50 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.08 per share of common stock. In addition, during 2010 we paid $205 million to acquire Total Logistic Control. Capital expenditures increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 and reflects increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Our debt balances increased 10% to $2.75 billion at December 31, 2010 due to acquisitions and higher vehicle capital spending levels. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 196% from 175% in 2009. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also increased to 203% from 183% in 2009. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 Outlook We enter 2011 very well positioned to profitably grow the business. For 2011, we expect to see the continuation of many of the same positive trends we experienced in 2010. We plan to benefit from productivity initiatives and operational efficiencies in our FMS business. This benefit will be partially offset by higher maintenance costs as our fleet continues to age. Earnings per share growth is expected from continued improvement in commercial rental performance, the impact of acquisitions, continued strong used vehicle sales results and the benefit of 2010 stock repurchases. Total revenue for the full year 2011 is forecast to be $5.73 billion, which is an increase of 12% compared with 2010. In FMS, contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to increase 2%. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 19%, driven by strong demand and higher pricing. Total SCS revenue is forecast to increase by 25% reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Total DCC revenue is expected to increase by 14% reflecting the impact of the Scully acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS On December 31, 2010, we acquired Total Logistic Control (TLC), which is a leading provider of comprehensive supply chain solutions to food, beverage, and consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers in the U.S. TLC provides customers a broad suite of end to end services, including distribution management, contract packaging services and solutions engineering. This acquisition will enhance our SCS capabilities and growth prospects in the areas of packaging and warehousing, including temperature controlled facilities. We completed four FMS acquisitions from 2008 to 2009, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition. Contractual Company Acquired Date Vehicles Customers Market Edart Leasing LLC February 2, 2009 1,600 340 Northeast U.S. Gordon Truck Leasing August 29, 2008 500 130 Pennsylvania Gator Leasing, Inc. May 12, 2008 2,300 300 Florida Lily Transportation Corp. January 11, 2008 1,600 200 Northeast U.S. On December 19, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. (CRSA) in Canada, as well as CRSA operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. This strategic acquisition added complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 21% in 2010 to $189 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $117 million. The increase in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects the impact of stronger results in our FMS and SCS business segments. FMS earnings increased due to improved global commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. This increase was partially offset by lower full service lease performance reflecting higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. SCS earnings increased due to improved high tech and global automotive industry volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. Net earnings increased 91% in 2010 to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2010 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $6 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. Earnings per share growth in 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $144 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflected significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global SCS automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million or $0.51 per diluted common share. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $3,712,153 3,567,836 4,454,251 4 % (20 )% Supply Chain Solutions 1,252,251 1,139,911 1,429,632 10 (20 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 482,583 470,956 547,751 2 (14 ) Eliminations (310,552 ) (291,449 ) (432,593 ) (7 ) 33 Total $5,136,435 4,887,254 5,999,041 5 % (19 )% Operating revenue(1) $4,158,239 4,062,512 4,590,080 2 % (11 )% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 5% to $5.14 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher fuel services revenue, operating revenue and subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.16 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increase in eliminations in 2010 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,441,924 2,229,539 2,959,518 10% (25)% Percentage of revenue 48% 46% 49% Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased in 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel costs and higher maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was driven by an increase in average U.S. fuel prices on lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. Operating expense decreased 25% to $2.23 billion in 2009 as a result of lower fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was due to lower average market prices and lower fuel volumes. The decrease was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,255,659 1,233,243 1,345,216 2% (8)% Percentage of revenue 24% 25% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 29% Salaries and employee related costs increased 2% to $1.26 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher incentive based compensation, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher driver costs, partially offset by lower retirement plans expense. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, increased 1% in 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2010 increased to approximately 25,900 compared to 22,900 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2009. The higher headcount was primarily due to the acquisition of TLC at the end of the year. Pension expense totaled $42 million in 2010 compared to $66 million in 2009. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2009 and the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect 2011 pension expense to decrease approximately $9 million primarily because of reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on plan assets in 2010. Our 2011 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount decreased 9% in 2009 compared with 2008. Pension expense increased by $65 million as a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $261,325 198,860 233,106 31% (15)% Percentage of revenue 5% 4% 4% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense increased 31% to $261 million in 2010 as a result of increased freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $833,841 881,216 836,149 (5 )% 5 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (28,727) (12,292) (39,020) 134 (68 ) Equipment rental 63,228 65,828 78,292 (4 ) (16 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense decreased 5% to $834 million in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale. The decline was also impacted by a prior year impairment charge on a Singapore facility. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs of $24 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be held for sale through 2010, the impact of acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2010 and 2009, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2011. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $5 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of each year, we complete our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $129,994 144,342 152,448 (10 )% (5 )% Effective interest rate 5.2% 5.4% 5.3% Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $(7,114 ) (3,657 ) 2,564 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery partially offset by lower income on investment securities. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 61,697 53,652 151,709 15 % (65 )% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 33.1% 37.3% 37.1% The 2010 effective income tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of domestic tax audits in 2010 and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of a statute of limitation. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (6,438 ) (28,172 ) (57,698 ) Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily included exit costs related to a leased facility and adverse legal developments. Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 included operating losses of $11 million and $12 million, respectively. During 2009 and 2008, we also incurred $17 million and $47 million, respectively, of pre tax restructuring and other charges (primarily exit related) related to discontinued operations.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 8,426 9,461 16,701 Dedicated Contract Carriage 10,849 11,597 15,102 Total $ 19,275 21,058 31,803 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 Outlook We enter 2011 very well positioned to profitably grow the business. For 2011, we expect to see the continuation of many of the same positive trends we experienced in 2010. We plan to benefit from productivity initiatives and operational efficiencies in our FMS business. This benefit will be partially offset by higher maintenance costs as our fleet continues to age. Earnings per share growth is expected from continued improvement in commercial rental performance, the impact of acquisitions, continued strong used vehicle sales results and the benefit of 2010 stock repurchases. Total revenue for the full year 2011 is forecast to be $5.73 billion, which is an increase of 12% compared with 2010. In FMS, contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to increase 2%. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 19%, driven by strong demand and higher pricing. Total SCS revenue is forecast to increase by 25% reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Total DCC revenue is expected to increase by 14% reflecting the impact of the Scully acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS Accounting Changes See Note 2, Accounting Changes, for a discussion of the impact of changes in accounting standards. ACQUISITIONS On December 31, 2010, we acquired Total Logistic Control (TLC), which is a leading provider of comprehensive supply chain solutions to food, beverage, and consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers in the U.S. TLC provides customers a broad suite of end to end services, including distribution management, contract packaging services and solutions engineering. This acquisition will enhance our SCS capabilities and growth prospects in the areas of packaging and warehousing, including temperature controlled facilities. We completed four FMS acquisitions from 2008 to 2009, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The FMS acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition. Contractual Company Acquired Date Vehicles Customers Market Edart Leasing LLC February 2, 2009 1,600 340 Northeast U.S. Gordon Truck Leasing August 29, 2008 500 130 Pennsylvania Gator Leasing, Inc.

January 11, 2008 1,600 200 Northeast U.S. On December 19, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Transpacific Container Terminal Ltd. and CRSA Logistics Ltd. (CRSA) in Canada, as well as CRSA operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. This strategic acquisition added complementary solutions to our SCS capabilities including consolidation services in key Asian hubs, as well as deconsolidation operations in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 21% in 2010 to $189 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $117 million. The increase in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects the impact of stronger results in our FMS and SCS business segments. FMS earnings increased due to improved global commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. This increase was partially offset by lower full service lease performance reflecting higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. SCS earnings increased due to improved high tech and global automotive industry volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. Net earnings increased 91% in 2010 to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2010 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $6 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. Earnings per share growth in 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $144 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflected significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global SCS automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million or $0.51 per diluted common share. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $3,712,153 3,567,836 4,454,251 4 % (20 )% Supply Chain Solutions 1,252,251 1,139,911 1,429,632 10 (20 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 482,583 470,956 547,751 2 (14 ) Eliminations (310,552 ) (291,449 ) (432,593 ) (7 ) 33 Total $5,136,435 4,887,254 5,999,041 5 % (19 )% Operating revenue(1) $4,158,239 4,062,512 4,590,080 2 % (11 )% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 5% to $5.14 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher fuel services revenue, operating revenue and subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.16 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increase in eliminations in 2010 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,441,924 2,229,539 2,959,518 10% (25)% Percentage of revenue 48% 46% 49% Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased in 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel costs and higher maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was driven by an increase in average U.S. fuel prices on lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. Operating expense decreased 25% to $2.23 billion in 2009 as a result of lower fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was due to lower average market prices and lower fuel volumes. The decrease was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,255,659 1,233,243 1,345,216 2% (8)% Percentage of revenue 24% 25% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 29% Salaries and employee related costs increased 2% to $1.26 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher incentive based compensation, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher driver costs, partially offset by lower retirement plans expense. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, increased 1% in 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2010 increased to approximately 25,900 compared to 22,900 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2009. The higher headcount was primarily due to the acquisition of TLC at the end of the year. Pension expense totaled $42 million in 2010 compared to $66 million in 2009. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2009 and the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect 2011 pension expense to decrease approximately $9 million primarily because of reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on plan assets in 2010. Our 2011 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount decreased 9% in 2009 compared with 2008. Pension expense increased by $65 million as a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $261,325 198,860 233,106 31% (15)% Percentage of revenue 5% 4% 4% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense increased 31% to $261 million in 2010 as a result of increased freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $833,841 881,216 836,149 (5 )% 5 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (28,727) (12,292) (39,020) 134 (68 ) Equipment rental 63,228 65,828 78,292 (4 ) (16 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense decreased 5% to $834 million in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale. The decline was also impacted by a prior year impairment charge on a Singapore facility. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs of $24 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be held for sale through 2010, the impact of acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2010 and 2009, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2011. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $5 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of each year, we complete our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million.

In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010/ 2009 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $1,313,426 1,246,968 5 % Operating revenue $1,061,939 1,019,822 4 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 49,608 31,800 56 % Provision for income taxes 8,146 8,130 Earnings from continuing operations 41,462 23,670 75 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (4,341 ) (15,422 ) (72 ) Net earnings $ 37,121 8,248 350 % Earnings (loss) per common share Diluted Continuing operations $ 0.80 0.43 86 % Discontinued operations (0.08 ) (0.28 ) (71 ) Net earnings $ 0.72 0.15 380 % Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 51,040 54,235 (6 )% Total revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.31 billion primarily due to higher operating revenue in all our business segments and higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT increased 21% in 2010 to $189 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $117 million. The increase in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflects the impact of stronger results in our FMS and SCS business segments. FMS earnings increased due to improved global commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. This increase was partially offset by lower full service lease performance reflecting higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. SCS earnings increased due to improved high tech and global automotive industry volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. Net earnings increased 91% in 2010 to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2010 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $6 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. Earnings per share growth in 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $144 million. Excluding restructuring and other items, comparable NBT declined 64% in 2009 to $157 million, and comparable earnings from continuing operations declined 65% to $95 million. The decrease in comparable NBT and earnings from continuing operations reflected significantly lower earnings in our FMS business segment because of a decline in commercial rental, full service lease and used vehicle sales as well as higher pension expense. NBT was also negatively impacted by lower global SCS automotive industry volumes. Net earnings decreased 69% in 2009 to $62 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2009 included losses from discontinued operations for SCS South America and Europe of $28 million or $0.51 per diluted common share. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $3,712,153 3,567,836 4,454,251 4 % (20 )% Supply Chain Solutions 1,252,251 1,139,911 1,429,632 10 (20 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 482,583 470,956 547,751 2 (14 ) Eliminations (310,552 ) (291,449 ) (432,593 ) (7 ) 33 Total $5,136,435 4,887,254 5,999,041 5 % (19 )% Operating revenue(1) $4,158,239 4,062,512 4,590,080 2 % (11 )% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 5% to $5.14 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher fuel services revenue, operating revenue and subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.16 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increase in eliminations in 2010 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,441,924 2,229,539 2,959,518 10% (25)% Percentage of revenue 48% 46% 49% Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased in 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel costs and higher maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was driven by an increase in average U.S. fuel prices on lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. Operating expense decreased 25% to $2.23 billion in 2009 as a result of lower fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was due to lower average market prices and lower fuel volumes. The decrease was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,255,659 1,233,243 1,345,216 2% (8)% Percentage of revenue 24% 25% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 29% Salaries and employee related costs increased 2% to $1.26 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher incentive based compensation, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher driver costs, partially offset by lower retirement plans expense. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, increased 1% in 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2010 increased to approximately 25,900 compared to 22,900 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2009. The higher headcount was primarily due to the acquisition of TLC at the end of the year. Pension expense totaled $42 million in 2010 compared to $66 million in 2009. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2009 and the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect 2011 pension expense to decrease approximately $9 million primarily because of reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on plan assets in 2010. Our 2011 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount decreased 9% in 2009 compared with 2008. Pension expense increased by $65 million as a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $261,325 198,860 233,106 31% (15)% Percentage of revenue 5% 4% 4% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense increased 31% to $261 million in 2010 as a result of increased freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $833,841 881,216 836,149 (5 )% 5 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (28,727) (12,292) (39,020) 134 (68 ) Equipment rental 63,228 65,828 78,292 (4 ) (16 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense decreased 5% to $834 million in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale. The decline was also impacted by a prior year impairment charge on a Singapore facility. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs of $24 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be held for sale through 2010, the impact of acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2010 and 2009, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2011. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $5 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of each year, we complete our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $129,994 144,342 152,448 (10 )% (5 )% Effective interest rate 5.2% 5.4% 5.3% Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $(7,114 ) (3,657 ) 2,564 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery partially offset by lower income on investment securities. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 61,697 53,652 151,709 15 % (65 )% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 33.1% 37.3% 37.1% The 2010 effective income tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of domestic tax audits in 2010 and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of a statute of limitation. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (6,438 ) (28,172 ) (57,698 ) Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily included exit costs related to a leased facility and adverse legal developments. Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 included operating losses of $11 million and $12 million, respectively. During 2009 and 2008, we also incurred $17 million and $47 million, respectively, of pre tax restructuring and other charges (primarily exit related) related to discontinued operations.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 8,426 9,461 16,701 Dedicated Contract Carriage 10,849 11,597 15,102 Total $ 19,275 21,058 31,803 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $3,712,153 3,567,836 4,454,251 4 % (20 )% Supply Chain Solutions 1,252,251 1,139,911 1,429,632 10 (20 ) Dedicated Contract Carriage 482,583 470,956 547,751 2 (14 ) Eliminations (310,552 ) (291,449 ) (432,593 ) (7 ) 33 Total $5,136,435 4,887,254 5,999,041 5 % (19 )% Operating revenue(1) $4,158,239 4,062,512 4,590,080 2 % (11 )% (1) We use operating revenue, a non GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses and as a measure of sales activity. FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Total revenue increased 5% to $5.14 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher fuel services revenue, operating revenue and subcontracted transportation. Operating revenue increased 2% to $4.16 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.9% due primarily to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Total revenue decreased 19% to $4.89 billion in 2009 reflecting lower fuel services and operating revenue. Operating revenue decreased 11% to $4.06 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial rental revenue and SCS automotive production volumes. To a lesser extent, operating revenue was also negatively impacted by lower SCS and DCC fuel pass throughs, unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower FMS contractual revenues partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total revenue in 2009 included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.4% due primarily to the weakening of the British pound and Mexican peso. Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. The increase in eliminations in 2010 reflects primarily the pass through of higher average fuel costs. The decrease in eliminations in 2009 reflects primarily the pass through of lower average fuel costs. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,441,924 2,229,539 2,959,518 10% (25)% Percentage of revenue 48% 46% 49% Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased in 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel costs and higher maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was driven by an increase in average U.S. fuel prices on lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. Operating expense decreased 25% to $2.23 billion in 2009 as a result of lower fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was due to lower average market prices and lower fuel volumes. The decrease was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,255,659 1,233,243 1,345,216 2% (8)% Percentage of revenue 24% 25% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 29% Salaries and employee related costs increased 2% to $1.26 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher incentive based compensation, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher driver costs, partially offset by lower retirement plans expense. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, increased 1% in 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2010 increased to approximately 25,900 compared to 22,900 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2009. The higher headcount was primarily due to the acquisition of TLC at the end of the year. Pension expense totaled $42 million in 2010 compared to $66 million in 2009. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2009 and the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect 2011 pension expense to decrease approximately $9 million primarily because of reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on plan assets in 2010. Our 2011 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount decreased 9% in 2009 compared with 2008. Pension expense increased by $65 million as a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $261,325 198,860 233,106 31% (15)% Percentage of revenue 5% 4% 4% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense increased 31% to $261 million in 2010 as a result of increased freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $833,841 881,216 836,149 (5 )% 5 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (28,727) (12,292) (39,020) 134 (68 ) Equipment rental 63,228 65,828 78,292 (4 ) (16 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense decreased 5% to $834 million in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale. The decline was also impacted by a prior year impairment charge on a Singapore facility. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs of $24 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be held for sale through 2010, the impact of acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2010 and 2009, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2011. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $5 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of each year, we complete our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $129,994 144,342 152,448 (10 )% (5 )% Effective interest rate 5.2% 5.4% 5.3% Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $(7,114 ) (3,657 ) 2,564 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery partially offset by lower income on investment securities. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 61,697 53,652 151,709 15 % (65 )% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 33.1% 37.3% 37.1% The 2010 effective income tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of domestic tax audits in 2010 and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of a statute of limitation. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (6,438 ) (28,172 ) (57,698 ) Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily included exit costs related to a leased facility and adverse legal developments. Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 included operating losses of $11 million and $12 million, respectively. During 2009 and 2008, we also incurred $17 million and $47 million, respectively, of pre tax restructuring and other charges (primarily exit related) related to discontinued operations.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 8,426 9,461 16,701 Dedicated Contract Carriage 10,849 11,597 15,102 Total $ 19,275 21,058 31,803 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $332,077 265,143 329,875 25 % (20) % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $193,006 165,915 227,616 16 % (27) % Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2),(3) 23,800 23,000 25,800 3 % (11) % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 76.1 % 68.0 % 71.4 % 810 bps (340) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Operating expense (exclusive of items shown separately) $2,441,924 2,229,539 2,959,518 10% (25)% Percentage of revenue 48% 46% 49% Operating expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased in 2010 primarily as a result of higher fuel costs and higher maintenance costs. The increase in fuel costs was driven by an increase in average U.S. fuel prices on lower fuel volumes. Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. The growth in maintenance costs reflects the impact of an aging global fleet. Operating expense decreased 25% to $2.23 billion in 2009 as a result of lower fuel costs. The decrease in fuel costs was due to lower average market prices and lower fuel volumes. The decrease was partially offset by higher maintenance costs and safety and insurance costs. The growth in safety and insurance costs reflects less favorable development in self insured loss reserves. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee related costs $1,255,659 1,233,243 1,345,216 2% (8)% Percentage of revenue 24% 25% 22% Percentage of operating revenue 30% 30% 29% Salaries and employee related costs increased 2% to $1.26 billion in 2010 primarily due to higher incentive based compensation, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher driver costs, partially offset by lower retirement plans expense. Average headcount, excluding discontinued operations, increased 1% in 2010. The number of employees at December 31, 2010 increased to approximately 25,900 compared to 22,900 (excluding those from discontinued operations) at December 31, 2009. The higher headcount was primarily due to the acquisition of TLC at the end of the year. Pension expense totaled $42 million in 2010 compared to $66 million in 2009. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2009 and the favorable impact from voluntary pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect 2011 pension expense to decrease approximately $9 million primarily because of reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on plan assets in 2010. Our 2011 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. Salaries and employee related costs decreased 8% to $1.23 billion in 2009 primarily due to lower headcount, favorable foreign exchange rate changes and lower incentive based compensation and commissions partially offset by higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions. Average headcount decreased 9% in 2009 compared with 2008. Pension expense increased by $65 million as a result of significant negative pension asset returns in 2008. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense increased 31% to $261 million in 2010 as a result of increased freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes.

Depreciation expense decreased 5% to $834 million in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale. The decline was also impacted by a prior year impairment charge on a Singapore facility. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs of $24 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be held for sale through 2010, the impact of acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2010 and 2009, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2011. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $5 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of each year, we complete our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Subcontracted transportation $261,325 198,860 233,106 31% (15)% Percentage of revenue 5% 4% 4% Subcontracted transportation expense represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties. Subcontracted transportation expense is directly impacted by whether we are acting as an agent or principal in our transportation management contracts. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis and carriage costs to third parties are recorded as subcontracted transportation expense. Subcontracted transportation expense increased 31% to $261 million in 2010 as a result of increased freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry. Subcontracted transportation expense decreased 15% to $199 million in 2009 as a result of decreased freight volumes. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Depreciation expense $833,841 881,216 836,149 (5 )% 5 % Gains on vehicle sales, net (28,727) (12,292) (39,020) 134 (68 ) Equipment rental 63,228 65,828 78,292 (4 ) (16 ) Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense decreased 5% to $834 million in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale. The decline was also impacted by a prior year impairment charge on a Singapore facility. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. Depreciation expense increased 5% to $881 million in 2009 because of increased write downs of $24 million in the carrying value of vehicles held for sale, accelerated depreciation of $10 million on certain classes of vehicles expected to be held for sale through 2010, the impact of acquisitions, higher average vehicle investments and impairment charges on a Singapore facility, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and a lower number of owned vehicles. We periodically review and adjust residual values, reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees for further discussion. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. In 2010 and 2009, we accelerated depreciation on certain classes of vehicles expected to be sold through 2011. The impact of this change increased depreciation by $5 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At the end of each year, we complete our annual depreciation review of the residual values and useful lives of our revenue earning equipment. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles and extent of alternative uses. Based on the results of the 2008 review, the adjustment to depreciation was not significant for 2009. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $129,994 144,342 152,448 (10 )% (5 )% Effective interest rate 5.2% 5.4% 5.3% Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) expense, net $(7,114 ) (3,657 ) 2,564 Miscellaneous (income) expense, net consists of investment (income) losses on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, (gains) losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, and non operating items. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery partially offset by lower income on investment securities. Miscellaneous (income) expense, net improved $6 million in 2009 due to better market performance of our investment securities partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction gains in 2009. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 6,406 21,480 See Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the charges related to these actions. Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 61,697 53,652 151,709 15 % (65 )% Effective tax rate from continuing operations 33.1% 37.3% 37.1% The 2010 effective income tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of domestic tax audits in 2010 and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of a statute of limitation. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (6,438 ) (28,172 ) (57,698 ) Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily included exit costs related to a leased facility and adverse legal developments. Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 included operating losses of $11 million and $12 million, respectively. During 2009 and 2008, we also incurred $17 million and $47 million, respectively, of pre tax restructuring and other charges (primarily exit related) related to discontinued operations.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $332,077 265,143 329,875 25 % (20) % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $193,006 165,915 227,616 16 % (27) % Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2),(3) 23,800 23,000 25,800 3 % (11) % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 76.1 % 68.0 % 71.4 % 810 bps (340) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The changes will increase pre tax earnings by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to higher average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net decreased 68% to $12 million in 2009 due to lower average pricing on vehicles sold primarily in our used truck class. Equipment rental consists primarily of rent expense for FMS revenue earning equipment under lease by us as lessee. Equipment rental decreased 4% to $63 million in 2010 primarily due to a lower number of leased vehicles partially offset by higher rental costs associated with investments in material handling equipment to support our SCS operations. Equipment rental decreased 16% to $66 million in 2009 because of a reduction in the average number of vehicles leased from third parties.

Interest expense decreased 5% to $144 million in 2009 because of lower average debt balances partially offset by a higher effective interest rate. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $0.7 million.

In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 5.7% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2009 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Ontario, Canada, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired. In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 6.5% 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010/ 2009 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $1,313,426 1,246,968 5 % Operating revenue $1,061,939 1,019,822 4 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 49,608 31,800 56 % Provision for income taxes 8,146 8,130 Earnings from continuing operations 41,462 23,670 75 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (4,341 ) (15,422 ) (72 ) Net earnings $ 37,121 8,248 350 % Earnings (loss) per common share Diluted Continuing operations $ 0.80 0.43 86 % Discontinued operations (0.08 ) (0.28 ) (71 ) Net earnings $ 0.72 0.15 380 % Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 51,040 54,235 (6 )% Total revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.31 billion primarily due to higher operating revenue in all our business segments and higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. The 2008 effective income tax rate benefited from enacted tax law changes in Massachusetts and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, for which the statute of limitation in various jurisdictions had expired which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3% of pre tax earnings. The benefits in 2008 were partially offset by the adverse impact of non deductible restructuring and other charges. On December 17, 2010 and September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, and the Small Business Job Act of 2010, respectively. These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes is expected to result in a net operating loss carryforward in 2011. In addition, these changes are expected to significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (6,438 ) (28,172 ) (57,698 ) Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2010 primarily included exit costs related to a leased facility and adverse legal developments. Pre tax loss from discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 included operating losses of $11 million and $12 million, respectively. During 2009 and 2008, we also incurred $17 million and $47 million, respectively, of pre tax restructuring and other charges (primarily exit related) related to discontinued operations.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 8,426 9,461 16,701 Dedicated Contract Carriage 10,849 11,597 15,102 Total $ 19,275 21,058 31,803 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Unallocated CSS costs increased due to higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total CSS costs decreased 9% in 2009 to $168 million reflecting lower spending across all functional areas as a result of cost reduction actions implemented in early 2009 and lower incentive based compensation. These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 8,426 9,461 16,701 Dedicated Contract Carriage 10,849 11,597 15,102 Total $ 19,275 21,058 31,803 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $332,077 265,143 329,875 25 % (20) % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $193,006 165,915 227,616 16 % (27) % Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2),(3) 23,800 23,000 25,800 3 % (11) % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 76.1 % 68.0 % 71.4 % 810 bps (340) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and NBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. NBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations). The following table sets forth equipment contribution included in NBT for our SCS and DCC segments: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions $ 8,426 9,461 16,701 Dedicated Contract Carriage 10,849 11,597 15,102 Total $ 19,275 21,058 31,803 CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the NBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs is allocated to the business segments. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $332,077 265,143 329,875 25 % (20) % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $193,006 165,915 227,616 16 % (27) % Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2),(3) 23,800 23,000 25,800 3 % (11) % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 76.1 % 68.0 % 71.4 % 810 bps (340) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion due primarily to higher fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel cost pass throughs. Operating revenue increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion reflecting higher commercial rental revenue partially offset by lower contractual revenue. Total and operating revenue in 2010 also included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.6%. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. However, the level of downsizings decreased toward the latter half of the year. We expect favorable contractual revenue comparisons next year due to acquisitions as well as a reduction in customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $332,077 265,143 329,875 25 % (20) % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $193,006 165,915 227,616 16 % (27) % Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2),(3) 23,800 23,000 25,800 3 % (11) % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 76.1 % 68.0 % 71.4 % 810 bps (340) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Years ended December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $332,077 265,143 329,875 25 % (20) % Lease customer rental revenue(1) $193,006 165,915 227,616 16 % (27) % Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2),(3) 23,800 23,000 25,800 3 % (11) % Commercial rental utilization power fleet 76.1 % 68.0 % 71.4 % 810 bps (340) bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS NBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were positively impacted by higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $3.57 billion due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue decreased 47% in 2009 because of lower average fuel prices as well as reduced gallons pumped. Operating revenue decreased 7% in 2009 to $2.82 billion reflecting declines in all product lines, especially commercial rental, in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions in 2009, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions. Total and operating revenue in 2009 also included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 1% as a result of fleet downsizing decisions and lower variable revenue from fewer miles driven by our customers with their fleets. Commercial rental revenue decreased 23% in 2009 reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. In 2009, we reduced the size and mix of our rental fleet in order to better align with market demand. The average global rental fleet size declined 13% in 2009 and year end fleet counts decreased by 15% compared with 2008. As a result of our fleet right sizing actions, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior year period for the first time in 2009. FMS NBT decreased 65% in 2009 to $140 million driven primarily by the economic slowdown and freight recession, which resulted in a decline in global commercial rental demand, lower full service lease performance and lower used vehicle sales results. Results in 2009 were also impacted by significantly higher pension expense. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand which drove lower utilization and, to a lesser extent, reduced pricing on a smaller fleet. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the freight recession, which resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases and downsizing of customer fleets. Used vehicle sales results declined primarily due to weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average inventory levels. Used vehicle inventory levels 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) improved during the second half of the year and finished the year 10% below the prior year. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. Our global fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment and contract maintenance vehicles is summarized as follows (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 End of period vehicle count By type: Trucks(1) 63,000 63,600 68,300 (1 )% (7 )% Tractors(2) 49,600 50,300 51,900 (1 ) (3 ) Trailers(3) 33,000 35,400 39,900 (7 ) (11 ) Other 3,100 3,100 3,300 (6 ) Total 148,700 152,400 163,400 (2 )% (7 )% By ownership: Owned 145,000 147,200 158,100 (1 )% (7 )% Leased 3,700 5,200 5,300 (29 ) (2 ) Total 148,700 152,400 163,400 (2 )% (7 )% By product line: Full service lease 111,100 115,100 120,600 (3 )% (5 )% Commercial rental 29,700 27,400 32,300 8 (15 ) Service vehicles and other 2,700 3,000 2,800 (10 ) 7 Active units 143,500 145,500 155,700 (1 ) (7 ) Held for sale 5,200 6,900 7,700 (25 ) (10 ) Total 148,700 152,400 163,400 (2 ) (7 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 33,400 34,400 35,500 (3 )% (3 )% Average vehicle count By product line: Full service lease 112,500 118,800 118,100 (5 )% 1 % Commercial rental 29,800 29,400 33,900 1 (13 ) Service vehicles and other 2,600 2,900 3,300 (10 ) (12 ) Active units 144,900 151,100 155,300 (4 ) (3 ) Held for sale 5,800 8,400 6,200 (31 ) 35 Total 150,700 159,500 161,500 (6 ) (1 ) Customer vehicles under contract maintenance 33,700 35,200 33,900 (4 )% 4 % (1) Generally comprised of Class 1 through Class 6 type vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) up to 26,000 pounds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ Number of Units 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 800 700 1,500 14 % (53 )% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 5,200 6,900 7,700 (25 ) (10 ) Other NLE units 2,000 2,900 2,900 (31 ) Total 8,000 10,500 12,100 (24 )% (13 )% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Unallocated CSS costs increased due to higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total CSS costs decreased 9% in 2009 to $168 million reflecting lower spending across all functional areas as a result of cost reduction actions implemented in early 2009 and lower incentive based compensation. These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010/ 2009 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $1,313,426 1,246,968 5 % Operating revenue $1,061,939 1,019,822 4 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 49,608 31,800 56 % Provision for income taxes 8,146 8,130 Earnings from continuing operations 41,462 23,670 75 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (4,341 ) (15,422 ) (72 ) Net earnings $ 37,121 8,248 350 % Earnings (loss) per common share Diluted Continuing operations $ 0.80 0.43 86 % Discontinued operations (0.08 ) (0.28 ) (71 ) Net earnings $ 0.72 0.15 380 % Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 51,040 54,235 (6 )% Total revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.31 billion primarily due to higher operating revenue in all our business segments and higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31 Change 2010/ 2009/ Number of Units 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 800 700 1,500 14 % (53 )% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 5,200 6,900 7,700 (25 ) (10 ) Other NLE units 2,000 2,900 2,900 (31 ) Total 8,000 10,500 12,100 (24 )% (13 )% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2010, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales and, to a lesser extent, the refresh and growth of the rental fleet. For 2009, the number of NYE units decreased reflecting lower new replacement lease activity. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. The number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. For 2009, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels. We expect NLE levels in 2011 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Unallocated CSS costs increased due to higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total CSS costs decreased 9% in 2009 to $168 million reflecting lower spending across all functional areas as a result of cost reduction actions implemented in early 2009 and lower incentive based compensation. These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2010 versus 2009 Total revenue increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion due to higher subcontracted transportation, higher operating revenue and favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue increased 5% to $1.00 billion primarily due to higher freight volumes particularly in the automotive industry and favorable foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by prior year contract rationalizations. For 2010, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively. We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons next year due to the impact of the TLC acquisition, higher overall freight volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue decreased 20% in 2009 to $1.14 billion and operating revenue decreased 21% in 2009 to $955 million. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased as a result of lower automotive production, overall freight volumes and fuel cost pass throughs. For 2009, SCS total revenue and operating revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively. SCS NBT decreased 37% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to significantly reduced North American automotive volumes which decreased NBT by $19 million, including costs incurred upon the termination of certain automotive operations. During the second quarter of 2009, several of our automotive customers filed for bankruptcy. We did not realize any losses on our pre petition accounts receivable with any of these customers.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

See Note 3, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. DCC NBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total revenue declined 14% in 2009 to $471 million and operating revenue declined 15% in 2009 to $457 million as a result of lower fuel cost pass throughs, lower freight volumes and non renewal of customer contracts. DCC NBT decreased 24% in 2009 to $38 million as a result of lower revenue, and to a lesser extent, increased self insurance costs. The increase in self insurance costs reflected less favorable development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves.

Unallocated CSS costs increased due to higher compensation costs. 2009 versus 2008 Total CSS costs decreased 9% in 2009 to $168 million reflecting lower spending across all functional areas as a result of cost reduction actions implemented in early 2009 and lower incentive based compensation. These items were partially offset by higher professional service fees on cost savings initiatives. Unallocated CSS costs decreased 6% in 2009 to $36 million primarily due to lower incentive based compensation offset slightly by higher spending on cost savings initiatives. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010/ 2009 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $1,313,426 1,246,968 5 % Operating revenue $1,061,939 1,019,822 4 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 49,608 31,800 56 % Provision for income taxes 8,146 8,130 Earnings from continuing operations 41,462 23,670 75 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (4,341 ) (15,422 ) (72 ) Net earnings $ 37,121 8,248 350 % Earnings (loss) per common share Diluted Continuing operations $ 0.80 0.43 86 % Discontinued operations (0.08 ) (0.28 ) (71 ) Net earnings $ 0.72 0.15 380 % Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 51,040 54,235 (6 )% Total revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.31 billion primarily due to higher operating revenue in all our business segments and higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Three months ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010/ 2009 (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $1,313,426 1,246,968 5 % Operating revenue $1,061,939 1,019,822 4 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 49,608 31,800 56 % Provision for income taxes 8,146 8,130 Earnings from continuing operations 41,462 23,670 75 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (4,341 ) (15,422 ) (72 ) Net earnings $ 37,121 8,248 350 % Earnings (loss) per common share Diluted Continuing operations $ 0.80 0.43 86 % Discontinued operations (0.08 ) (0.28 ) (71 ) Net earnings $ 0.72 0.15 380 % Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 51,040 54,235 (6 )% Total revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.31 billion primarily due to higher operating revenue in all our business segments and higher fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.06 billion primarily due to higher commercial rental revenue, and to a lesser extent, improved SCS high tech and automotive volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower full service lease revenue. Total revenue and operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (NBT) increased 56% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $50 million which reflects significantly higher earnings in our FMS business segment driven by better commercial rental performance and improved used vehicle results. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, allocated between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a net benefit of $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. The tax benefits related to a favorable settlement of prior tax years audits and the expiration of a statute of limitation. Restructuring and other items related to costs incurred on the TLC acquisition and were partially offset by a gain on sale of an international supply chain facility. Earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a net benefit of $1 million or $0.02 per diluted common share related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws partially offset by an impairment charge related to the facility sold in 2010. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 exceeded the net earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations. FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Three months ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 948,060 900,219 5 % Supply Chain Solutions 325,094 302,085 8 Dedicated Contract Carriage 121,825 119,267 2 Eliminations (81,553 ) (74,603 ) (9 ) Total $1,313,426 1,246,968 5 % Operating Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 726,254 699,452 4 % Supply Chain Solutions 258,309 247,596 4 Dedicated Contract Carriage 119,257 113,444 5 Eliminations (41,881 ) (40,670 ) (3 ) Total $1,061,939 1,019,822 4 % NBT: Fleet Management Solutions $ 49,498 31,946 55 % Supply Chain Solutions 12,327 11,739 5 Dedicated Contract Carriage 6,529 6,922 (6 ) Eliminations (4,770 ) (4,883 ) 2 63,584 45,724 39 Unallocated Central Support Services (10,825 ) (11,253 ) 4 Restructuring and other charges, net and other items (3,151 ) (2,671 ) NM Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 49,608 31,800 56 % Fleet Management Solutions Total revenue increased 5% to $948 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting higher operating revenue and fuel services revenue. Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In 2009, we discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15 million ($15 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a lease facility, which we no longer operate, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the substantial liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

Operating revenue increased 4% to $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of higher commercial rental revenue reflecting strong global market demand and higher pricing. The increase in operating revenue was partially offset by lower contractual revenue reflecting the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. FMS NBT increased 55% to $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflecting significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation costs and investments in sales and information technology investments. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 8% to $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 4% to $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased primarily due to improved high tech and automotive volumes and new business. SCS NBT increased 5% to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of better operating performance particularly in high tech accounts partially offset by higher compensation costs and a pension settlement charge of $1 million. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 2% to $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating revenue increased 5% to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the pass through of higher fuel costs and net new business. DCC NBT decreased 6% to $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower operating performance reflecting increased driver costs. Central Support Services Unallocated CSS costs decreased 4% to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of lower professional fees partially offset by higher compensation costs. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Financing activities 78,166 (542,016 ) (148,152 ) Investing activities (982,464 ) (448,610 ) (1,103,468 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,723 1,794 1,408 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 125,459 (3,876 ) (2,043 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $985 million in 2009 compared with $1.25 billion in 2008 because of lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. Cash used in financing activities increased to $542 million in 2009 compared with $148 million in 2008 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) reflecting higher net debt repayments resulting from less borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $449 million in 2009 compared with $1.10 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2009. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,028,034 984,956 1,248,169 Sales of revenue earning equipment 220,843 211,002 257,679 Sales of operating property and equipment 13,844 4,634 3,727 Collections on direct finance leases 61,767 65,242 61,096 Other, net 3,178 209 395 Total cash generated 1,327,666 1,266,043 1,571,066 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) (1,230,401 ) Free cash flow $ 257,574 614,090 340,665 Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. Free cash flow increased to $614 million in 2009 compared with $341 million in 2008 as lower net capital expenditures were partially offset by lower cash based earnings and higher pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2011 to be approximately $265 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line and also the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies and warehouse facilities and equipment. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following is a summary of capital expenditures: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 646,671 547,750 985,924 Commercial rental 378,678 7,436 171,128 1,025,349 555,186 1,157,052 Operating property and equipment 62,302 56,216 108,284 Total capital expenditures(1) 1,087,651 611,402 1,265,336 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (17,559 ) 40,551 (34,935 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,070,092 651,953 1,230,401 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately $2 million and $1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Capital expenditures decreased 52% to $611 million in 2009 as a result of reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $1.75 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing. Working Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Current assets $ 1,023,301 $ 880,373 Current liabilities 1,131,519 850,274 Working capital $ (108,218 ) $ 30,099 Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(108) million at December 31, 2010 compared with $30 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to an increase of $188 million in the current portion of long term debt. Excluding the increase in short term debt, other working capital components increased $49 million resulting from higher cash flows partially offset by higher accrued compensation. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (raised August 2010) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2010) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. We can borrow up to $875 million under a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of thirteen lending institutions led by Bank of America N.A., Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo N.A. The global credit facility matures in April 2012 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. This facility can also be used to issue up to $75 million in letters of credit (there were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010). At our option, the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on LIBOR, prime, federal funds or local equivalent rates. The agreement provides for annual facility fees, which range from 22.5 basis points to 62.5 basis points, and are based on Ryders long term credit ratings. The credit facilitys current annual facility fee is 37.5 basis points, which applies to the total facility size of $875 million. The credit facility contains no provisions limiting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to Ryders business operations; however, the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, cross default provisions, and certain affirmative and negative covenants. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangible assets. The ratio at December 31, 2010 was 189%. At December 31, 2010, $506 million was available under the credit facility, net of the support for commercial paper borrowings. Our global revolving credit facility permits us to refinance short term commercial paper obligations on a long term basis. Settlement of short term commercial paper obligations not expected to require the use of working capital are classified as long term as we have both the intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis. We have a trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we sell certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote, consolidated subsidiary of Ryder, that in turn sells, on a revolving basis, an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The costs under the program may vary based on changes in interest rates. The available proceeds amounts that may be received under the program are limited to $175 million. In 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations.

(2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) October 2010, we renewed the trade receivables purchase and sales program. If no event occurs which causes early termination, the 364 day program will expire on October 28, 2011. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the program. Historically, we have established asset backed securitization programs whereby we have sold beneficial interests in certain long term vehicle leases and related vehicle residuals to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the beneficial interest to a special purpose securitization trust in exchange for cash. The securitization trust funds the cash requirement with the issuance of asset backed securities, secured or otherwise collateralized by the beneficial interest in the long term vehicle leases and the residual value of the vehicles. The securitization provides us with further liquidity and access to additional capital markets based on market conditions. On June 18, 2008, Ryder Funding II LP, a special purpose bankruptcy remote subsidiary wholly owned by Ryder, filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of $600 million in asset backed notes. The registration statement became effective on November 6, 2008 and remains effective until November 6, 2011. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of unsecured medium term notes maturing in March 2016. If the notes are downgraded following, and as a result of, a change of control, the note holder can require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The medium term notes were issued to take advantage of historically low interest rates and fund capital expenditures and debt maturities. At December 31, 2010, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 506 Trade receivables program 175 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: Years ended December 31 2010 2009 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,497,691 2,862,799 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 174,939 148,256 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 14,169 2,014 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (175,000 ) (276,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (73,668 ) (243,710 ) Net change from discontinued operations (2,955 ) (9,427 ) 237,485 (378,867 ) Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 3,328 (6,290 ) Addition of capital lease obligations, including acquisitions 2,164 1,949 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items 6,334 18,100 Total changes in debt 249,311 (365,108 ) Debt balance at December 31 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 26% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: December 31, % December 31, % 2010 of Equity 2009 of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 2,747,002 196% $ 2,497,691 175% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles(1) 99,797 118,828 Total obligations $ 2,846,799 203% $ 2,616,519 183% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2010 was driven by increased funding needs to support acquisitions and stock repurchases. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. We periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations, to diversify our funding among different classes of investors (e.g., regional banks, pension plans, insurance companies, etc.) and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments. These sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions. In general, these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet, as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt. Accordingly, sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense. Our sale leaseback transactions contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles (residual value guarantees) that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term. The amount of future payments for residual value guarantees will depend on the market for used vehicles and the condition of the vehicles at time of disposal. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transactions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Guarantees. We executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require us to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations, financing agreements, environmental matters, and agreements to sell business assets. In each of these instances, payment by us is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement. Normally, these procedures allow us to dispute the other partys claim. Additionally, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim. We have entered into individual indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, through which we will indemnify such director acting in good faith against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities arising out of such directors service as a director of Ryder. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these agreements is generally unlimited. We cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, including the indemnification agreements, due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement. Historically, no such payments made by Ryder have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters, the loss would not result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $9 million and $11 million, respectively, and we accrued $8 million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009 as a corresponding liability. See Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million.

We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 417,932 980,814 558,273 763,185 2,720,204 Capital lease obligations 2,153 4,240 3,952 1,024 11,369 Total debt, including capital leases(1) 420,085 985,054 562,225 764,209 2,731,573 Interest on debt(2) 116,741 180,245 119,156 124,968 541,110 Operating leases(3) 100,156 116,839 62,839 27,230 307,064 Purchase obligations(4) 309,927 18,447 11,545 7,746 347,665 Total contractual cash obligations 526,824 315,531 193,540 159,944 1,195,839 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 110,697 87,669 33,756 27,214 259,336 Other long term liabilities(5),(6),(7) 6,103 5,529 2,200 46,535 60,367 Total $ 1,063,709 1,393,783 791,721 997,902 4,247,115 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2010. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2011, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $15 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2011 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $396 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The amounts exclude $67 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (UK) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. The freeze of the Canadian defined benefit plan created a pre tax curtailment gain in 2008 of $4 million. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the other plan amendments in 2010 or 2009. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $423 million and $412 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2010 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate partially offset by higher actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2010. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was 12% in 2010. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2010, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $64 million compared with $131 million in 2009. We made voluntary pension contributions of $50 million in 2010. We estimate 2011 required pension contributions will be $15 million. After considering the 2010 contributions and asset performance, the projected estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $396 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We participate in twelve U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2010, approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 4% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $5 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, collectively as of January 2009, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $29 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $54 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $52 million in 2008. During 2010, we increased our annual dividend to $1.08 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.99 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and a fair value of $2.12 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2010 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2010, we had $742 million of variable rate debt, including the impact of an interest rate swap, which effectively changed $250 million of fixed rate debt instruments with an interest rate of 6.0% to LIBOR based floating rate debt with an interest rate of 2.63%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement at December 31, 2010 was recorded as an asset totaling $15 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 was $741 million. A hypothetical 10 basis point change in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in the Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (page 50) of PART II of this report. 59 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $4 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2010, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2011 by approximately $100 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2010, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The change will increase earnings in 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2010, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.65% from 7.9% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 67% equity securities and 33% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2011, we changed our target asset allocation to 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $658 million at the end of 2010 compared with a loss of $638 million at the end of 2009. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2010 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2011 and future years will be $484 million. The effect on years beyond 2011 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2010 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2010 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Effect on Impact on 2010 Net December 31, 2010 Assumed Rate Change Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.0 million Discount rate increase 6.20% + 0.25 % $3.0 million $3 million Discount rate decrease 6.20% 0.25 % + $3.0 million + $3 million Actual return on assets 7.65% +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $243 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a (charge) benefit of $(3) million, $1 million, and $23 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2010, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2011 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaled $356 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

These statements, as well as other forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward looking statements. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. The risks included in the Annual Report are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2010 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2010, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $597 million. The fair value of our reporting units with a material amount of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $1 million to approximately $395 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. In transportation management arrangements where we act as principal, revenue is reported on a gross basis for subcontracted transportation billed to our customers. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $365 million and $320 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred tax valuation 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $39 million and $37 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, salaries and employee related costs as a percentage of operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS NBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS NBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC NBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. We believe that the comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. As 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
